# Constants and Variables

## Declaring Constants and Variables

Constants and variables must be declared before they’re used.  
The let keyword and variables with the var keyword.

```swift
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
var currentLoginAttempt = 0

var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
```

## Type Annotations

The phrase “of type String” means “can store any String value.” Think of it as meaning “the type of thing” (or “the kind of thing”) that can be stored.

```swift
var welcomeMessage: String
welcomeMessage = "Hello"
```

```swift
var red, green, blue: Double
```

## Naming Constants and Variables
Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:

```swift
let π = 3.14159
let 你好 = "你好世界"
let 🐶🐮 = "dogcow"
```

Constant and variable names can’t contain:
- whitespace characters
- mathematical symbols
- arrows
- private-use Unicode scalar values
- line- and box-drawing characters

Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name.  

Once you’ve declared a constant or variable of a certain type, you can’t declare it again with 
the same name, or change it to store values of a different type.  

Nor can you change a constant into a variable or a variable into a constant.

```swift
var friendlyWelcome = "Hello!"
friendlyWelcome = "Bonjour!"
// friendlyWelcome is now "Bonjour!"
```

```swift
let languageName = "Swift"
languageName = "Swift++"
// This is a compile-time error: languageName cannot be changed.
```

## Printing Constants and Variables
You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the print(_:separator:terminator:) function:

```swift
let friendlyWelcome = "Bonjour!"
print(friendlyWelcome)
// Prints "Bonjour!"
```

The print(_:separator:terminator:) function prints its output in Xcode’s “console” pane.  
Wrap the name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the opening parenthesis:

```swift
print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \(friendlyWelcome)")
// Prints "The current value of friendlyWelcome is Bonjour!"
```

## Comments

- Comments in Swift are very similar to comments in C. Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//):
```swift
// This is a comment
```
- Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/):
```swift
/* This is also a comment
but is written over multiple lines. */
```

- Multiline comments in Swift can be nested inside other multiline comments.
```swift
/* This is the start of the first multiline comment.
 /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */
This is the end of the first multiline comment. */
```

## Semicolons

Swift doesn’t require you to write a semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish.   
However, semicolons are required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line:

```swift
let cat = "🐱"; print(cat)
// Prints "🐱"
```

## Integers

Integers are whole numbers with **no fractional component**, such as 42 and -23. Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero).  
  
Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit forms. These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type Int32. Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names.


### Integer Bounds

You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its min and max properties:

```swift
let minValue = UInt8.min  // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8
let maxValue = UInt8.max  // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8
```

### Int

In most cases, you don’t need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your code. Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size as the current platform’s native word size:

- On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int32.
- On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int64.

Even on 32-bit platforms, Int can store any value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, and is large enough for many integer ranges.

### UInt

Swift also provides **an unsigned integer type**, UInt, which has the same size as the current platform’s native word size:

- On a 32-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt32.
- On a 64-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt64.

> Use UInt only when you specifically need an unsigned integer type with the same size as the platform’s native word size.

## Floating-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15.  
  
Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller than can be stored in an Int. Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:

- Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
- Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.
 > Double has a precision of at least **15 decimal digits**, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as** 6 decimal digits**. The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code. In situations where either type would be appropriate, **Double is preferred**.

## Type Safety and Type Inference

If part of your code requires a String, you can’t pass it an Int by mistake.  
  
Because Swift is type safe, it performs type checks when compiling your code and flags any mismatched types as errors. This enables you to catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.  

If you don’t specify the type of value you need, Swift uses **type inference** to work out the appropriate type. Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.  
  
Swift always chooses Double (rather than Float) when inferring the type of floating-point numbers.  
  
If you combine integer and floating-point literals in an expression, a type of Double will be inferred from the context:  
Example:

```swift
let meaningOfLife = 42
// meaningOfLife is inferred to be of type Int

let pi = 3.14159
// pi is inferred to be of type Double

let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159
// anotherPi is also inferred to be of type Double
```
## Numeric Literals

Integer literals can be written as:
- A decimal number, with no prefix
- A binary number, with a 0b prefix
- An octal number, with a 0o prefix
- A hexadecimal number, with a 0x prefix

```swift
let decimalInteger = 17
let binaryInteger = 0b10001       // 17 in binary notation
let octalInteger = 0o21           // 17 in octal notation
let hexadecimalInteger = 0x11     // 17 in hexadecimal notation
```
All of these floating-point literals have a decimal value of 12.1875:
```swift
let decimalDouble = 12.1875
let exponentDouble = 1.21875e1
let hexadecimalDouble = 0xC.3p0
```

Numeric literals can contain extra formatting to make them easier to read. Both integers and floats can be padded with extra zeros and can contain underscores to help with **readability**. Neither type of formatting affects the underlying value of the literal:

```swift
let paddedDouble = 000123.456
let oneMillion = 1_000_000
let justOverOneMillion = 1_000_000.000_000_1
```

## Numeric Type Conversion

Use other integer types only when they’re specifically needed for the task at hand, because of explicitly sized data from an external source, or for performance, memory usage, or other necessary optimization. Using explicitly sized types in these situations helps to catch any accidental value overflows and implicitly documents the nature of the data being used.

### Integer Conversion

A number that won’t fit into a constant or variable of a sized integer type is reported as an error when your code is compiled:

```swift
let cannotBeNegative: UInt8 = -1
// UInt8 can't store negative numbers, and so this will report an error
let tooBig: Int8 = Int8.max + 1
// Int8 can't store a number larger than its maximum value,
// and so this will also report an error
```
Because each numeric type can store a different range of values, you must opt in to numeric type conversion on a case-by-case basis. This opt-in approach prevents hidden conversion errors and helps make type conversion intentions explicit in your code.

```swift
let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000
let one: UInt8 = 1
let twoThousandAndOne = twoThousand + UInt16(one)
```

### Integer and Floating-Point Conversion

Conversions between integer and floating-point numeric types must be made explicit:

```
let three = 3
let pointOneFourOneFiveNine = 0.14159
let pi = Double(three) + pointOneFourOneFiveNine
// pi equals 3.14159, and is inferred to be of type Double

let integerPi = Int(pi)
// integerPi equals 3, and is inferred to be of type Int
```

## Type Aliases

Type aliases define an alternative name for an existing type. You define type aliases with the **typealias keyword**.  
  
Type aliases are useful when you want to refer to an existing type by a name that’s contextually more appropriate, such as when working with data of a specific size from an external source:  
```swift
typealias AudioSample = UInt16
```
Once you define a type alias, you can use the alias anywhere you might use the original name:

```swift
var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min
// maxAmplitudeFound is now 0
```

## Booleans

Swift has a basic Boolean type, called Bool. Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false. Swift provides two Boolean constant values, true and false:

```swift
let orangesAreOrange = true
let turnipsAreDelicious = false

if turnipsAreDelicious {
    print("Mmm, tasty turnips!")
} else {
    print("Eww, turnips are horrible.")
}
// Prints "Eww, turnips are horrible."
```

Swift’s type safety prevents non-Boolean values from being substituted for Bool. The following example reports a compile-time error:

```swift
let i = 1
if i {
    // this example will not compile, and will report an error
}

if i == 1 {
    // this example will compile successfully
}
```

## Tuples

Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value. The values within a tuple can be of any type and don’t have to be of the same type as each other.  
  
In this example, (404, "Not Found") is a tuple that describes an HTTP status code.

```swift
let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")
// http404Error is of type (Int, String), and equals (404, "Not Found")
```
You can create **tuples from any permutation of types**, and they can contain as many different types as you like. There’s nothing stopping you from having a tuple of type (Int, Int, Int), or (String, Bool), or indeed any other permutation you require.
  
You can decompose a tuple’s contents into separate constants or variables, which you then access as usual:
```swift
let (statusCode, statusMessage) = http404Error
print("The status code is \(statusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 404"
print("The status message is \(statusMessage)")
// Prints "The status message is Not Found"
```

If you only need some of the tuple’s values, ignore parts of the tuple with an underscore (_) when you decompose the tuple:

```swift
let (justTheStatusCode, _) = http404Error
print("The status code is \(justTheStatusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 404"
```
Alternatively, access the individual element values in a tuple using index numbers starting at zero:

```swift
print("The status code is \(http404Error.0)")
// Prints "The status code is 404"
print("The status message is \(http404Error.1)")
// Prints "The status message is Not Found"
```

You can name the individual elements in a tuple when the tuple is defined:

```swift
let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")
// (int,string)

print("The status code is \(http200Status.statusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 200"
print("The status message is \(http200Status.description)")
// Prints "The status message is OK"
```

Tuples are particularly useful as the return values of functions.   
A function that tries to retrieve a web page might return the (Int, String) tuple type to describe the success or failure of the page retrieval.   
By returning a tuple with two distinct values, each of a different type, the function provides more useful information about its outcome than if it could only return a single value of a single type.
> Tuples are useful for simple groups of related values. They’re not suited to the creation of complex data structures. If your data structure is likely to be more complex, model it as a class or structure, rather than as a tuple.

## Optionals

You use optionals in situations where a value may be absent. An optional represents two possibilities: 
- Either there is a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value - there isn’t a value at all.
>The concept of optionals doesn’t exist in C or Objective-C.  
The nearest thing in Objective-C is the ability to return nil from a method that would otherwise return an object, with nil meaning “the absence of a valid object.”   
However, this only works for objects—it doesn’t work for structures, basic C types, or enumeration values. For these types, Objective-C methods typically return a special value (such as NSNotFound) to indicate the absence of a value. This approach assumes that the method’s caller knows there’s a special value to test against and remembers to check for it. Swift’s optionals let you indicate the absence of a value for any type at all, without the need for special constants.

Swift’s Int type has an initializer which tries to convert a String value into an Int value. However, not every string can be converted into an integer. The string "123" can be converted into the numeric value 123, but the string "hello, world" doesn’t have an obvious numeric value to convert to.  
  
The example below uses the initializer to try to convert a String into an Int:

```swift
let possibleNumber = "123"
let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)
// convertedNumber is inferred to be of type "Int?", or "optional Int"
```

### nil
You set an optional variable to a valueless state by assigning it the special value nil:

```swift
var serverResponseCode: Int? = 404
// serverResponseCode contains an actual Int value of 404
serverResponseCode = nil
// serverResponseCode now contains no value
```

If you define an optional variable without providing a default value, the variable is **automatically** set to nil for you:

```swift
var surveyAnswer: String?
// surveyAnswer is automatically set to nil

```
> Swift’s nil isn’t the same as nil in Objective-C.   
> - In Objective-C, nil is a pointer to a nonexistent object.   
> - In Swift, nil isn’t a pointer—it’s the absence of a value of a certain type.   
>> Optionals of any type can be set to nil, not just object types.

### If Statements and Forced Unwrapping

You can use an if statement to find out whether an optional contains a value by comparing the optional against nil. You perform this comparison with the “equal to” operator (==) or the “not equal to” operator (!=).  
  
If an optional has a value, it’s considered to be “not equal to” nil:

```swift
if convertedNumber != nil {
    print("convertedNumber contains some integer value.")
}
// Prints "convertedNumber contains some integer value."
```

Once you’re sure that the optional does contain a value, you can access its underlying value by adding **an exclamation point (!) to the end of the optional’s name**. The exclamation point effectively says, “I know that this optional definitely has a value; please use it.” This is known as forced unwrapping of the optional’s value:

```swift
if convertedNumber != nil {
    print("convertedNumber has an integer value of \(convertedNumber!).")
}
// Prints "convertedNumber has an integer value of 123."
```
> Trying to use ! to access a nonexistent optional value triggers a runtime error. Always make sure that an optional contains a non-nil value before using ! to force-unwrap its value.

### Optional Binding

You use optional binding to find out whether an optional contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant or variable. Optional binding can be used with if and while statements to check for a value inside an optional, and to extract that value into a constant or variable, as part of a single action.

```swift
//Write an optional binding for an if statement as follows:
if let `constantName` = `someOptional` {
    `statements`
}
```

```swift
let possibleNumber = "123"

if let actualNumber = Int(possibleNumber) {
    print("The string \"\(possibleNumber)\" has an integer value of \(actualNumber)")
} else {
    print("The string \"\(possibleNumber)\" couldn't be converted to an integer")
}
// Prints "The string "123" has an integer value of 123"
```

If you don’t need to refer to the original, optional constant or variable after accessing the value it contains, you can use the same name for the new constant or variable:

```swift
let myNumber = Int(possibleNumber)
// Here, myNumber is an optional integer
if let myNumber = myNumber {
    // Here, myNumber is a non-optional integer
    print("My number is \(myNumber)")
}
// Prints "My number is 123"
```

Because this kind of code is so common, you can use a shorter spelling to unwrap an optional value: write just the name of the constant or variable that you’re unwrapping. The new, unwrapped constant or variable implicitly uses the same name as the optional value.

```swift
if let myNumber {
    print("My number is \(myNumber)")
}
// Prints "My number is 123"
```

You can include as **many optional bindings** and **Boolean conditions** in a single if statement as you need to, separated by commas. If any of the values in the optional bindings are **nil** or any **Boolean condition evaluates to false**, the whole if statement’s condition is considered to be **false**. The following if statements are equivalent:

```swift
if let firstNumber = Int("4"), let secondNumber = Int("42"), firstNumber < secondNumber && secondNumber < 100 {
    print("\(firstNumber) < \(secondNumber) < 100")
}
// Prints "4 < 42 < 100"

if let firstNumber = Int("4") {
    if let secondNumber = Int("42") {
        if firstNumber < secondNumber && secondNumber < 100 {
            print("\(firstNumber) < \(secondNumber) < 100")
        }
    }
}
// Prints "4 < 42 < 100"
```
>Constants and variables created with optional binding in an if statement are available only within the body of the if statement. In contrast, the constants and variables created with a guard statement are available in the lines of code that follow the guard statement, as described in Early Exit.


### Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals

Sometimes it’s clear from a program’s structure that an optional will always have a value, after that value is first set. In these cases, it’s useful to remove the need to check and unwrap the optional’s value every time it’s accessed, because it can be safely assumed to have a value all of the time.  
  
These kinds of optionals are defined as implicitly unwrapped optionals. You write an implicitly unwrapped optional by placing an exclamation point (String!) rather than a question mark (String?) after the type that you want to make optional.

```swift
let possibleString: String? = "An optional string."
let forcedString: String = possibleString! // requires an exclamation point

let assumedString: String! = "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."
let implicitString: String = assumedString // no need for an exclamation point
```

You can think of an implicitly unwrapped optional as giving permission for the optional to be force-unwrapped if needed. When you use an implicitly unwrapped optional value, Swift first tries to use it as an ordinary optional value; if it can’t be used as an optional, Swift force-unwraps the value.

```swift
let optionalString = assumedString
// The type of optionalString is "String?" and assumedString isn't force-unwrapped.
```

If an implicitly unwrapped optional is nil and you try to access its wrapped value, you’ll trigger a runtime error. The result is exactly the same as if you place an exclamation point after a normal optional that doesn’t contain a value.

You can check whether an implicitly unwrapped optional is nil the same way you check a normal optional:

```swift
if assumedString != nil {
    print(assumedString!)
}
// Prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."
```
You can also use an implicitly unwrapped optional with optional binding, to check and unwrap its value in a single statement:

```swift
if let definiteString = assumedString {
    print(definiteString)
}
// Prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."
```
> Don’t use an implicitly unwrapped optional when there’s a possibility of a variable becoming nil at a later point. Always use a normal optional type if you need to check for a nil value during the lifetime of a variable.

## Error Handling

You use error handling to respond to error conditions your program may encounter during execution.
  
In contrast to optionals, which can use the presence or absence of a value to communicate success or failure of a function, error handling allows you to determine the underlying cause of failure, and, if necessary, propagate the error to another part of your program.
  
When a function encounters an error condition, it throws an error. That function’s caller can then catch the error and respond appropriately.

```swift
func canThrowAnError() throws {
    // this function may or may not throw an error
}
```

A function indicates that it can throw an error by including the throws keyword in its declaration. When you call a function that can throw an error, you prepend the try keyword to the expression.
  
Swift automatically propagates errors out of their current scope until they’re handled by a catch clause.

```swift
do {
    try canThrowAnError()
    // no error was thrown
} catch {
    // an error was thrown
}
```

A do statement creates a new containing scope, which allows errors to be propagated to one or more catch clauses.

```swift
func makeASandwich() throws {
    // ...
}

do {
    try makeASandwich()
    eatASandwich()
} catch SandwichError.outOfCleanDishes {
    washDishes()
} catch SandwichError.missingIngredients(let ingredients) {
    buyGroceries(ingredients)
}
```

## Assertions and Preconditions

Assertions and preconditions are checks that happen at runtime.
  
Using assertions and preconditions isn’t a substitute for designing your code in such a way that invalid conditions are unlikely to arise. However, using them to enforce valid data and state causes your app to terminate more predictably if an invalid state occurs, and helps make the problem easier to debug. Stopping execution as soon as an invalid state is detected also helps limit the damage caused by that invalid state.
  
The difference between assertions and preconditions is in when they’re checked: Assertions are checked only in debug builds, but preconditions are checked in both debug and production builds. In production builds, the condition inside an assertion isn’t evaluated. This means you can use as many assertions as you want during your development process, without impacting performance in production.


### Debugging with Assertions

You write an assertion by calling the assert(_:_:file:line:) function from the Swift standard library. You pass this function an expression that evaluates to true or false and a message to display if the result of the condition is false. For example:

```swift
let age = -3
assert(age >= 0, "A person's age can't be less than zero.")
// This assertion fails because -3 isn't >= 0.
```

You can omit the assertion message—for example, when it would just repeat the condition as prose.

```swift
assert(age >= 0)
```
If the code already checks the condition, you use the assertionFailure(_:file:line:) function to indicate that an assertion has failed. For example:

```swift
if age > 10 {
    print("You can ride the roller-coaster or the ferris wheel.")
} else if age >= 0 {
    print("You can ride the ferris wheel.")
} else {
    assertionFailure("A person's age can't be less than zero.")
}
```


### Enforcing Preconditions

Use a precondition whenever a condition has the potential to be false, but must definitely be true for your code to continue execution. For example, use a precondition to check that a subscript isn’t out of bounds, or to check that a function has been passed a valid value.

You write a precondition by calling the precondition(_:_:file:line:) function. You pass this function an expression that evaluates to true or false and a message to display if the result of the condition is false. For example:

```swift
// In the implementation of a subscript...
precondition(index > 0, "Index must be greater than zero.")
```
