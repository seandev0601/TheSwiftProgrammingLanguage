# Constants and Variables

## Declaring Constants and Variables

Constants and variables must be declared before they’re used.  
The let keyword and variables with the var keyword.

```swift
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
var currentLoginAttempt = 0

var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
```

## Type Annotations

The phrase “of type String” means “can store any String value.” Think of it as meaning “the type of thing” (or “the kind of thing”) that can be stored.

```swift
var welcomeMessage: String
welcomeMessage = "Hello"
```

```swift
var red, green, blue: Double
```

## Naming Constants and Variables
Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:

```swift
let π = 3.14159
let 你好 = "你好世界"
let 🐶🐮 = "dogcow"
```

Constant and variable names can’t contain:
- whitespace characters
- mathematical symbols
- arrows
- private-use Unicode scalar values
- line- and box-drawing characters

Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name.  

Once you’ve declared a constant or variable of a certain type, you can’t declare it again with 
the same name, or change it to store values of a different type.  

Nor can you change a constant into a variable or a variable into a constant.

```swift
var friendlyWelcome = "Hello!"
friendlyWelcome = "Bonjour!"
// friendlyWelcome is now "Bonjour!"
```

```swift
let languageName = "Swift"
languageName = "Swift++"
// This is a compile-time error: languageName cannot be changed.
```

## Printing Constants and Variables
You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the print(_:separator:terminator:) function:

```swift
let friendlyWelcome = "Bonjour!"
print(friendlyWelcome)
// Prints "Bonjour!"
```

The print(_:separator:terminator:) function prints its output in Xcode’s “console” pane.  
Wrap the name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the opening parenthesis:

```swift
print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \(friendlyWelcome)")
// Prints "The current value of friendlyWelcome is Bonjour!"
```
