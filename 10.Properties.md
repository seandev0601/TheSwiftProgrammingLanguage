# Properties

Properties associate values with a particular class, structure, or enumeration. Stored properties store constant and variable values as part of an instance, whereas computed properties calculate (rather than store) a value. Computed properties are provided by **classes, structures, and enumerations**. Stored properties are provided only by **classes and structures**.
  
Stored and computed properties are usually associated with instances of a particular type. However, properties can also be associated with the type itself. Such properties are known as type properties.
  
In addition, you can define property observers to monitor changes in a property’s value, which you can respond to with custom actions. Property observers can be added to stored properties you define yourself, and also to properties that a subclass inherits from its superclass.

## Stored Properties

In its simplest form, a stored property is a constant or variable that’s stored as part of an instance of a particular class or structure. Stored properties can be either variable stored properties (introduced by the var keyword) or constant stored properties (introduced by the let keyword).
  
The example below defines a structure called FixedLengthRange, which describes a range of integers whose range length can’t be changed after it’s created:

```swift
struct FixedLengthRange {
    var firstValue: Int
    let length: Int
}
var rangeOfThreeItems = FixedLengthRange(firstValue: 0, length: 3)
// the range represents integer values 0, 1, and 2
rangeOfThreeItems.firstValue = 6
// the range now represents integer values 6, 7, and 8
```

Instances of FixedLengthRange have a variable stored property called firstValue and a constant stored property called length. In the example above, length is initialized when the new range is created and can’t be changed thereafter, because it’s a constant property.

### Stored Properties of Constant Structure Instances

If you create an instance of a structure and assign that instance to a constant, you can’t modify the instance’s properties, even if they were declared as variable properties:

let rangeOfFourItems = FixedLengthRange(firstValue: 0, length: 4)
// this range represents integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3
rangeOfFourItems.firstValue = 6
// this will report an error, even though firstValue is a variable property

### Lazy Stored Properties

A lazy stored property is a property whose initial value isn’t calculated until the first time it’s used. You indicate a lazy stored property by writing the lazy modifier before its declaration.

> **You must always declare a lazy property as a variable** (with the var keyword), because its initial value might not be retrieved until after instance initialization completes. Constant properties must always have a value before initialization completes, and therefore can’t be declared as lazy.
  
Lazy properties are also useful when the initial value for a property requires complex or computationally expensive setup that shouldn’t be performed unless or until it’s needed.
  
The example below uses a lazy stored property to avoid unnecessary initialization of a complex class. This example defines two classes called DataImporter and DataManager, neither of which is shown in full:

```swift
class DataImporter {
    /*
    DataImporter is a class to import data from an external file.
    The class is assumed to take a nontrivial amount of time to initialize.
    */
    var filename = "data.txt"
    // the DataImporter class would provide data importing functionality here
}

class DataManager {
    lazy var importer = DataImporter()
    var data: [String] = []
    // the DataManager class would provide data management functionality here
}

let manager = DataManager()
manager.data.append("Some data")
manager.data.append("Some more data")
// the DataImporter instance for the importer property hasn't yet been created
```

Because it’s marked with the lazy modifier, the DataImporter instance for the importer property is only created when the importer property is first accessed, such as when its filename property is queried:

```swift
print(manager.importer.filename)
// the DataImporter instance for the importer property has now been created
// Prints "data.txt"
```

> If a property marked with the lazy modifier is accessed by multiple threads simultaneously and the property hasn’t yet been initialized, there’s no guarantee that the property will be initialized only once.

### Stored Properties and Instance Variables
  
Swift unifies these concepts into a single property declaration. 
  
A Swift property doesn’t have a corresponding instance variable, and the backing store for a property isn’t accessed directly. 
  
This approach avoids confusion about how the value is accessed in different contexts and simplifies the property’s declaration into a single, definitive statement.
  
All information about the property—including its name, type, and memory management characteristics—is defined in a single location as part of the type’s definition.

## Computed Properties

In addition to stored properties, classes, structures, and enumerations can define computed properties, which don’t actually store a value. Instead, they provide a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly.

```swift
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}
struct Size {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0
}
struct Rect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    var center: Point {
        get {
            let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
            let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
            return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
        }
        set(newCenter) {
            origin.x = newCenter.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newCenter.y - (size.height / 2)
        }
    }
}
var square = Rect(origin: Point(x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
                  size: Size(width: 10.0, height: 10.0))
let initialSquareCenter = square.center
// initialSquareCenter is at (5.0, 5.0)
square.center = Point(x: 15.0, y: 15.0)
print("square.origin is now at (\(square.origin.x), \(square.origin.y))")
// Prints "square.origin is now at (10.0, 10.0)"
```

This example defines three structures for working with geometric shapes:

- Point encapsulates the x- and y-coordinate of a point.
- Size encapsulates a width and a height.
- Rect defines a rectangle by an origin point and a size.

### Shorthand Setter Declaration

If a computed property’s setter **doesn’t define a name** for the new value to be set, a **default name of newValue** is used. Here’s an alternative version of the Rect structure that takes advantage of this shorthand notation:

```swift
struct AlternativeRect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    var center: Point {
        get {
            let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
            let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
            return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
        }
        set {
            origin.x = newValue.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newValue.y - (size.height / 2)
        }
    }
}
```

### Shorthand Getter Declaration

If the entire body of a getter is a single expression, **the getter implicitly returns that expression**. Here’s an another version of the Rect structure that takes advantage of this shorthand notation and the shorthand notation for setters:

```swift
struct CompactRect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    var center: Point {
        get {
            Point(x: origin.x + (size.width / 2),
                  y: origin.y + (size.height / 2))
        }
        set {
            origin.x = newValue.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newValue.y - (size.height / 2)
        }
    }
}
```

### Read-only Computed Properties

A computed property with a getter but no setter is known as a read-only computed property. A read-only computed property always returns a value, and can be accessed through dot syntax, but can’t be set to a different value.
  
You can simplify the declaration of a read-only computed property by removing the get keyword and its braces:

```swift
struct Cuboid {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0, depth = 0.0
    var volume: Double {
        return width * height * depth
    }
}
let fourByFiveByTwo = Cuboid(width: 4.0, height: 5.0, depth: 2.0)
print("the volume of fourByFiveByTwo is \(fourByFiveByTwo.volume)")
// Prints "the volume of fourByFiveByTwo is 40.0"
```

This structure also has a read-only computed property called volume, which calculates and returns the current **volume** of the cuboid. It doesn’t make sense for volume to be settable, because it would be ambiguous as to which values of width, height, and depth should be used for a particular volume value. Nonetheless, it’s useful for a Cuboid to provide a read-only computed property to enable external users to discover its current calculated volume.

## Property observers

Property observers observe and respond to changes in a property’s value. Property observers are called every time a property’s value is set, even if the new value is the same as the property’s current value.
  
You can add property observers in the following places:

- Stored properties that you define
- Stored properties that you inherit
- Computed properties that you inherit

You have the option to define either or both of these observers on a property:

- willSet is called just before the value is stored.
- didSet is called immediately after the new value is stored.

> The willSet and didSet observers of superclass properties are called when a property is set in a subclass initializer, after the superclass initializer has been called. They aren’t called while a class is setting its own properties, before the superclass initializer has been called.
  
Here’s an example of willSet and didSet in action. The example below defines a new class called StepCounter, which tracks the total number of steps that a person takes while walking. This class might be used with input data from a pedometer or other step counter to keep track of a person’s exercise during their daily routine.

```swift
class StepCounter {
    var totalSteps: Int = 0 {
        willSet(newTotalSteps) {
            print("About to set totalSteps to \(newTotalSteps)")
        }
        didSet {
            if totalSteps > oldValue  {
                print("Added \(totalSteps - oldValue) steps")
            }
        }
    }
}
let stepCounter = StepCounter()
stepCounter.totalSteps = 200
// About to set totalSteps to 200
// Added 200 steps
stepCounter.totalSteps = 360
// About to set totalSteps to 360
// Added 160 steps
stepCounter.totalSteps = 896
// About to set totalSteps to 896
// Added 536 steps
```

This example’s willSet observer uses a custom parameter name of newTotalSteps for the upcoming new value. In this example, it simply prints out the value that’s about to be set.
  
The didSet observer is called after the value of totalSteps is updated. It compares the new value of totalSteps against the old value. If the total number of steps has increased, a message is printed to indicate how many new steps have been taken. 
  
The didSet observer doesn’t provide a custom parameter name for the old value, and **the default name of oldValue** is used instead.

## Property Wrappers

A property wrapper adds a layer of separation between code that manages how a property is stored and the code that defines a property.
  
For example, if you have properties that provide thread-safety checks or store their underlying data in a database, you have to write that code on every property. When you use a property wrapper, you write the management code once when you define the wrapper, and then reuse that management code by applying it to multiple properties.
  
To define a property wrapper, you make a structure, enumeration, or class that defines a wrappedValue property. In the code below, the TwelveOrLess structure ensures that the value it wraps always contains a number less than or equal to 12. If you ask it to store a larger number, it stores 12 instead.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct TwelveOrLess {
    private var number = 0
    var wrappedValue: Int {
        get { return number }
        set { number = min(newValue, 12) }
    }
}
```

The setter ensures that new values are less than or equal to 12, and the getter returns the stored value.
  
You apply a wrapper to a property by writing the wrapper’s name before the property as an attribute. Here’s a structure that stores a rectangle that uses the TwelveOrLess property wrapper to ensure its dimensions are always 12 or less:

```swift
struct SmallRectangle {
    @TwelveOrLess var height: Int
    @TwelveOrLess var width: Int
}

var rectangle = SmallRectangle()
print(rectangle.height)
// Prints "0"

rectangle.height = 10
print(rectangle.height)
// Prints "10"

rectangle.height = 24
print(rectangle.height)
// Prints "12"
```

The height and width properties get their initial values from the definition of TwelveOrLess, which sets TwelveOrLess.number to zero.
  
When you apply a wrapper to a property, the compiler synthesizes code that provides storage for the wrapper and code that provides access to the property through the wrapper.
  
You could write code that uses the behavior of a property wrapper, without taking advantage of the special attribute syntax. For example, here’s a version of SmallRectangle from the previous code listing that wraps its properties in the TwelveOrLess structure explicitly, instead of writing @TwelveOrLess as an attribute:

```swift
struct SmallRectangle {
    private var _height = TwelveOrLess()
    private var _width = TwelveOrLess()
    var height: Int {
        get { return _height.wrappedValue }
        set { _height.wrappedValue = newValue }
    }
    var width: Int {
        get { return _width.wrappedValue }
        set { _width.wrappedValue = newValue }
    }
}
```

The _height and _width properties store an instance of the property wrapper, TwelveOrLess. The getter and setter for height and width wrap access to the wrappedValue property.

### Setting Initial Values for Wrapped Properties

The code in the examples above sets the initial value for the wrapped property by giving number an initial value in the definition of TwelveOrLess. Code that uses this property wrapper can’t specify a different initial value for a property that’s wrapped by TwelveOrLess—for example, the definition of SmallRectangle can’t give height or width initial values. To support setting an initial value or other customization, the property wrapper needs to add an initializer. Here’s an expanded version of TwelveOrLess called SmallNumber that defines initializers that set the wrapped and maximum value:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct SmallNumber {
    private var maximum: Int
    private var number: Int

    var wrappedValue: Int {
        get { return number }
        set { number = min(newValue, maximum) }
    }

    init() {
        maximum = 12
        number = 0
    }
    init(wrappedValue: Int) {
        maximum = 12
        number = min(wrappedValue, maximum)
    }
    init(wrappedValue: Int, maximum: Int) {
        self.maximum = maximum
        number = min(wrappedValue, maximum)
    }
}
```

The definition of SmallNumber includes three initializers—init(), init(wrappedValue:), and init(wrappedValue:maximum:)—which the examples below use to set the wrapped value and the maximum value.
  
When you apply a wrapper to a property and you don’t specify an initial value, Swift uses the init() initializer to set up the wrapper. For example:

```swift
struct ZeroRectangle {
    @SmallNumber var height: Int
    @SmallNumber var width: Int
}

var zeroRectangle = ZeroRectangle()
print(zeroRectangle.height, zeroRectangle.width)
// Prints "0 0"
```

When you specify an initial value for the property, Swift uses the init(wrappedValue:) initializer to set up the wrapper. For example:

```swift
struct UnitRectangle {
    @SmallNumber var height: Int = 1
    @SmallNumber var width: Int = 1
}

var unitRectangle = UnitRectangle()
print(unitRectangle.height, unitRectangle.width)
// Prints "1 1"
```

When you write arguments in parentheses after the custom attribute, Swift uses the initializer that accepts those arguments to set up the wrapper. For example, if you provide an initial value and a maximum value, Swift uses the init(wrappedValue:maximum:) initializer:

```swift
struct NarrowRectangle {
    @SmallNumber(wrappedValue: 2, maximum: 5) var height: Int
    @SmallNumber(wrappedValue: 3, maximum: 4) var width: Int
}

var narrowRectangle = NarrowRectangle()
print(narrowRectangle.height, narrowRectangle.width)
// Prints "2 3"

narrowRectangle.height = 100
narrowRectangle.width = 100
print(narrowRectangle.height, narrowRectangle.width)
// Prints "5 4"
```

When you include property wrapper arguments, you can also specify an initial value using assignment. Swift treats the assignment like a wrappedValue argument and uses the initializer that accepts the arguments you include. For example:

```swift
struct MixedRectangle {
    @SmallNumber var height: Int = 1
    @SmallNumber(maximum: 9) var width: Int = 2
}

var mixedRectangle = MixedRectangle()
print(mixedRectangle.height)
// Prints "1"

mixedRectangle.height = 20
print(mixedRectangle.height)
// Prints "12"
```

The instance of SmallNumber that wraps height is created by calling SmallNumber(wrappedValue: 1), which uses the default maximum value of 12. The instance that wraps width is created by calling SmallNumber(wrappedValue: 2, maximum: 9).

### Projecting a Value From a Property Wrapper

In addition to the wrapped value, a property wrapper can expose additional functionality by defining a projected value—for example, a property wrapper that manages access to a database can expose a flushDatabaseConnection() method on its projected value.The name of the projected value is the same as the wrapped value, except it begins with a dollar sign ($). Because your code can’t define properties that start with $ the projected value never interferes with properties you define.
  
In the SmallNumber example above, if you try to set the property to a number that’s too large, the property wrapper adjusts the number before storing it. The code below adds a projectedValue property to the SmallNumber structure to keep track of whether the property wrapper adjusted the new value for the property before storing that new value.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct SmallNumber {
    private var number: Int
    private(set) var projectedValue: Bool

    var wrappedValue: Int {
        get { return number }
        set {
            if newValue > 12 {
                number = 12
                projectedValue = true
            } else {
                number = newValue
                projectedValue = false
            }
        }
    }

    init() {
        self.number = 0
        self.projectedValue = false
    }
}
struct SomeStructure {
    @SmallNumber var someNumber: Int
}
var someStructure = SomeStructure()

someStructure.someNumber = 4
print(someStructure.$someNumber)
// Prints "false"

someStructure.someNumber = 55
print(someStructure.$someNumber)
// Prints "true"
```

Writing someStructure.$someNumber accesses the wrapper’s projected value. After storing a small number like four, the value of someStructure.$someNumber is false. However, the projected value is true after trying to store a number that’s too large, like 55.

When you access a projected value from code that’s part of the type, like a property getter or an instance method, you can omit self. before the property name, just like accessing other properties. The code in the following example refers to the projected value of the wrapper around height and width as $height and $width:

```swift
enum Size {
    case small, large
}

struct SizedRectangle {
    @SmallNumber var height: Int
    @SmallNumber var width: Int

    mutating func resize(to size: Size) -> Bool {
        switch size {
        case .small:
            height = 10
            width = 20
        case .large:
            height = 100
            width = 100
        }
        return $height || $width
    }
}
```

## Global and Local Variables

The capabilities described above for computing and observing properties are also available to global variables and local variables. 

- Global variables are variables that are defined outside of any function, method, closure, or type context. 
- Local variables are variables that are defined within a function, method, or closure context.

you can also define computed variables and define observers for stored variables, in either a global or local scope. Computed variables calculate their value, rather than storing it, and they’re written in the same way as computed properties.

> Global constants and variables are always computed lazily, in a similar manner to Lazy Stored Properties. Unlike lazy stored properties, global constants and variables don’t need to be marked with the lazy modifier.
  
> Local constants and variables are never computed lazily.

You can apply **a property wrapper to a local stored variable**, but **not to a global variable or a computed variable**. For example, in the code below, myNumber uses SmallNumber as a property wrapper.

```swift
func someFunction() {
    @SmallNumber var myNumber: Int = 0

    myNumber = 10
    // now myNumber is 10

    myNumber = 24
    // now myNumber is 12
}
```

## Type Properties

Instance properties are properties that belong to an instance of a particular type. Every time you create a new instance of that type, it has its own set of property values, separate from any other instance.
  
You can also define properties that belong to the type itself, not to any one instance of that type. There will only ever be one copy of these properties, no matter how many instances of that type you create. These kinds of properties are called type properties.
  
Type properties are useful for defining values that are universal to all instances of a particular type, such as a constant property that all instances can use (like a static constant in C), or a variable property that stores a value that’s global to all instances of that type (like a static variable in C).
  
Stored type properties can be variables or constants. Computed type properties are always declared as variable properties, in the same way as computed instance properties.

### Type Property Syntax

n Swift, however, type properties are written as part of the type’s definition, within the type’s outer curly braces, and each type property is explicitly scoped to the type it supports.
  
You define type properties with the static keyword. For computed type properties for class types, you can use the class keyword instead to allow subclasses to override the superclass’s implementation. The example below shows the syntax for stored and computed type properties:

```swift
struct SomeStructure {
    static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
    static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 1
    }
}
enum SomeEnumeration {
    static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
    static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 6
    }
}
class SomeClass {
    static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
    static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 27
    }
    class var overrideableComputedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 107
    }
}
```

### Querying and Setting Type Properties

Type properties are queried and set with dot syntax, just like instance properties. However, type properties are queried and set on the type, not on an instance of that type. For example:

```swift
print(SomeStructure.storedTypeProperty)
// Prints "Some value."
SomeStructure.storedTypeProperty = "Another value."
print(SomeStructure.storedTypeProperty)
// Prints "Another value."
print(SomeEnumeration.computedTypeProperty)
// Prints "6"
print(SomeClass.computedTypeProperty)
// Prints "27"
```

The examples that follow use two stored type properties as part of a structure that models an audio level meter for a number of audio channels. Each channel has an integer audio level between 0 and 10 inclusive.
  
The figure below illustrates how two of these audio channels can be combined to model a stereo audio level meter. When a channel’s audio level is 0, none of the lights for that channel are lit. When the audio level is 10, all of the lights for that channel are lit. In this figure, the left channel has a current level of 9, and the right channel has a current level of 7:
  
The audio channels described above are represented by instances of the AudioChannel structure:

```swift
struct AudioChannel {
    static let thresholdLevel = 10
    static var maxInputLevelForAllChannels = 0
    var currentLevel: Int = 0 {
        didSet {
            if currentLevel > AudioChannel.thresholdLevel {
                // cap the new audio level to the threshold level
                currentLevel = AudioChannel.thresholdLevel
            }
            if currentLevel > AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels {
                // store this as the new overall maximum input level
                AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels = currentLevel
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The AudioChannel structure defines two stored type properties to support its functionality. The first, thresholdLevel, defines the maximum threshold value an audio level can take. This is a constant value of 10 for all AudioChannel instances. If an audio signal comes in with a higher value than 10, it will be capped to this threshold value (as described below).
  
The second type property is a variable stored property called maxInputLevelForAllChannels. This keeps track of the maximum input value that has been received by any AudioChannel instance. It starts with an initial value of 0.
  
The AudioChannel structure also defines a stored instance property called currentLevel, which represents the channel’s current audio level on a scale of 0 to 10.
  
The currentLevel property has a didSet property observer to check the value of currentLevel whenever it’s set. This observer performs two checks:
  
- If the new value of currentLevel is greater than the allowed thresholdLevel, the property observer caps currentLevel to thresholdLevel.
- If the new value of currentLevel (after any capping) is higher than any value previously received by any AudioChannel instance, the property observer stores the new currentLevel value in the maxInputLevelForAllChannels type property.

You can use the AudioChannel structure to create two new audio channels called leftChannel and rightChannel, to represent the audio levels of a stereo sound system:

```swift
var leftChannel = AudioChannel()
var rightChannel = AudioChannel()
```

If you set the currentLevel of the left channel to 7, you can see that the maxInputLevelForAllChannels type property is updated to equal 7:

```swift
leftChannel.currentLevel = 7
print(leftChannel.currentLevel)
// Prints "7"
print(AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels)
// Prints "7"
```

If you try to set the currentLevel of the right channel to 11, you can see that the right channel’s currentLevel property is capped to the maximum value of 10, and the maxInputLevelForAllChannels type property is updated to equal 10:

```swift
rightChannel.currentLevel = 11
print(rightChannel.currentLevel)
// Prints "10"
print(AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels)
// Prints "10"
```
