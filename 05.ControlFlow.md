# Control Flow

Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include while loops to perform a task multiple times; if, guard, and switch statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

## For-In Loops

You use the for-in loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in an array, ranges of numbers, or characters in a string.
  
This example uses a for-in loop to iterate over the items in an array:

```swift
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
// Hello, Anna!
// Hello, Alex!
// Hello, Brian!
// Hello, Jack!
```

You can also iterate over a dictionary to access its key-value pairs. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple when the dictionary is iterated, and you can decompose the (key, value) tuple’s members as explicitly named constants for use within the body of the for-in loop.

```swift
let numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
    print("\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs")
}
// cats have 4 legs
// ants have 6 legs
// spiders have 8 legs
```

You can also use for-in loops with numeric ranges. This example prints the first few entries in a five-times table:

```swift
for index in 1...5 {
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}
// 1 times 5 is 5
// 2 times 5 is 10
// 3 times 5 is 15
// 4 times 5 is 20
// 5 times 5 is 25
```

In the example above, index is a constant whose value is automatically set at the start of each iteration of the loop. As such, index doesn’t have to be declared before it’s used. It’s implicitly declared simply by its inclusion in the loop declaration, without the need for a let declaration keyword.
  
If you don’t need each value from a sequence, you can ignore the values by using an underscore in place of a variable name.

```swift
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"
```

In some situations, you might not want to use closed ranges, which include both endpoints. Consider drawing the tick marks for every minute on a watch face. You want to draw 60 tick marks, starting with the 0 minute. Use the half-open range operator (..<) to include the lower bound but not the upper bound. For more about ranges, see Range Operators.

```swift
let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..<minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}
```

Some users might want fewer tick marks in their UI. They could prefer one mark every 5 minutes instead. Use the stride(from:to:by:) function to skip the unwanted marks.

```swift
let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}
```

Closed ranges are also available, by using stride(from:through:by:) instead:

```swift
let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
```

## While Loops

A while loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. These kinds of loops are best used when the number of iterations isn’t known before the first iteration begins. Swift provides two kinds of while loops:

- while evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop.
- repeat-while evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.

### While

A while loop starts by evaluating a single condition. If the condition is true, a set of statements is repeated until the condition becomes false.
  
Here’s the general form of a while loop:

```
while `condition` {
    `statements`
}
```

This example plays a simple game of Snakes and Ladders (also known as Chutes and Ladders):

![snakes and ladders](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/snakesAndLadders_2x.png)

- The board has 25 squares, and the aim is to land on or beyond square 25.
- The player’s starting square is “square zero”, which is just off the bottom-left corner of the board.
- Each turn, you roll a six-sided dice and move by that number of squares, following the horizontal path indicated by the dotted arrow above.
- If your turn ends at the bottom of a ladder, you move up that ladder.
- If your turn ends at the head of a snake, you move down that snake.

The game board is represented by an array of Int values. Its size is based on a constant called finalSquare, which is used to initialize the array and also to check for a win condition later in the example. Because the players start off the board, on “square zero”, the board is initialized with 26 zero Int values, not 25.

let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
Some squares are then set to have more specific values for the snakes and ladders. Squares with a ladder base have a positive number to move you up the board, whereas squares with a snake head have a negative number to move you back down the board.

board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
Square 3 contains the bottom of a ladder that moves you up to square 11. To represent this, board[03] is equal to +08, which is equivalent to an integer value of 8 (the difference between 3 and 11). To align the values and statements, the unary plus operator (+i) is explicitly used with the unary minus operator (-i) and numbers lower than 10 are padded with zeros. (Neither stylistic technique is strictly necessary, but they lead to neater code.)

```swift
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
while square < finalSquare {
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
    if square < board.count {
        // if we're still on the board, move up or down for a snake or a ladder
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
```

### Repeat-While

The other variation of the while loop, known as the repeat-while loop, performs a single pass through the loop block first, before considering the loop’s condition. It then continues to repeat the loop until the condition is false.

Here’s the general form of a repeat-while loop:

```swift
repeat {
    `statements`
} while `condition`
```

Here’s the Snakes and Ladders example again, written as a repeat-while loop rather than a while loop. The values of finalSquare, board, square, and diceRoll are initialized in exactly the same way as with a while loop.

```swift
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
```

In this version of the game, the first action in the loop is to check for a ladder or a snake. No ladder on the board takes the player straight to square 25, and so it isn’t possible to win the game by moving up a ladder. Therefore, it’s safe to check for a snake or a ladder as the first action in the loop.

At the start of the game, the player is on “square zero”. board[0] always equals 0 and has no effect.

```swift
repeat {
    // move up or down for a snake or ladder
    square += board[square]
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
} while square < finalSquare
print("Game over!")
```

After the code checks for snakes and ladders, the dice is rolled and the player is moved forward by diceRoll squares. The current loop execution then ends.
