# Control Flow

Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include while loops to perform a task multiple times; if, guard, and switch statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

## For-In Loops

You use the for-in loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in an array, ranges of numbers, or characters in a string.
  
This example uses a for-in loop to iterate over the items in an array:

```swift
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
// Hello, Anna!
// Hello, Alex!
// Hello, Brian!
// Hello, Jack!
```

You can also iterate over a dictionary to access its key-value pairs. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple when the dictionary is iterated, and you can decompose the (key, value) tuple’s members as explicitly named constants for use within the body of the for-in loop.

```swift
let numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
    print("\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs")
}
// cats have 4 legs
// ants have 6 legs
// spiders have 8 legs
```

You can also use for-in loops with numeric ranges. This example prints the first few entries in a five-times table:

```swift
for index in 1...5 {
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}
// 1 times 5 is 5
// 2 times 5 is 10
// 3 times 5 is 15
// 4 times 5 is 20
// 5 times 5 is 25
```

In the example above, index is a constant whose value is automatically set at the start of each iteration of the loop. As such, index doesn’t have to be declared before it’s used. It’s implicitly declared simply by its inclusion in the loop declaration, without the need for a let declaration keyword.
  
If you don’t need each value from a sequence, you can ignore the values by using an underscore in place of a variable name.

```swift
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"
```

In some situations, you might not want to use closed ranges, which include both endpoints. Consider drawing the tick marks for every minute on a watch face. You want to draw 60 tick marks, starting with the 0 minute. Use the half-open range operator (..<) to include the lower bound but not the upper bound. For more about ranges, see Range Operators.

```swift
let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..<minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}
```

Some users might want fewer tick marks in their UI. They could prefer one mark every 5 minutes instead. Use the stride(from:to:by:) function to skip the unwanted marks.

```swift
let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}
```

Closed ranges are also available, by using stride(from:through:by:) instead:

```swift
let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
```

## While Loops

A while loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. These kinds of loops are best used when the number of iterations isn’t known before the first iteration begins. Swift provides two kinds of while loops:

- while evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop.
- repeat-while evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.

### While

A while loop starts by evaluating a single condition. If the condition is true, a set of statements is repeated until the condition becomes false.
  
Here’s the general form of a while loop:

```
while `condition` {
    `statements`
}
```

This example plays a simple game of Snakes and Ladders (also known as Chutes and Ladders):

![snakes and ladders](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/snakesAndLadders_2x.png)

- The board has 25 squares, and the aim is to land on or beyond square 25.
- The player’s starting square is “square zero”, which is just off the bottom-left corner of the board.
- Each turn, you roll a six-sided dice and move by that number of squares, following the horizontal path indicated by the dotted arrow above.
- If your turn ends at the bottom of a ladder, you move up that ladder.
- If your turn ends at the head of a snake, you move down that snake.

The game board is represented by an array of Int values. Its size is based on a constant called finalSquare, which is used to initialize the array and also to check for a win condition later in the example. Because the players start off the board, on “square zero”, the board is initialized with 26 zero Int values, not 25.

let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
Some squares are then set to have more specific values for the snakes and ladders. Squares with a ladder base have a positive number to move you up the board, whereas squares with a snake head have a negative number to move you back down the board.

board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
Square 3 contains the bottom of a ladder that moves you up to square 11. To represent this, board[03] is equal to +08, which is equivalent to an integer value of 8 (the difference between 3 and 11). To align the values and statements, the unary plus operator (+i) is explicitly used with the unary minus operator (-i) and numbers lower than 10 are padded with zeros. (Neither stylistic technique is strictly necessary, but they lead to neater code.)

```swift
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
while square < finalSquare {
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
    if square < board.count {
        // if we're still on the board, move up or down for a snake or a ladder
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
```

### Repeat-While

The other variation of the while loop, known as the repeat-while loop, performs a single pass through the loop block first, before considering the loop’s condition. It then continues to repeat the loop until the condition is false.

Here’s the general form of a repeat-while loop:

```swift
repeat {
    `statements`
} while `condition`
```

Here’s the Snakes and Ladders example again, written as a repeat-while loop rather than a while loop. The values of finalSquare, board, square, and diceRoll are initialized in exactly the same way as with a while loop.

```swift
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
```

In this version of the game, the first action in the loop is to check for a ladder or a snake. No ladder on the board takes the player straight to square 25, and so it isn’t possible to win the game by moving up a ladder. Therefore, it’s safe to check for a snake or a ladder as the first action in the loop.

At the start of the game, the player is on “square zero”. board[0] always equals 0 and has no effect.

```swift
repeat {
    // move up or down for a snake or ladder
    square += board[square]
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
} while square < finalSquare
print("Game over!")
```

After the code checks for snakes and ladders, the dice is rolled and the player is moved forward by diceRoll squares. The current loop execution then ends.

## Conditional Statements

Swift provides two ways to add conditional branches to your code: the if statement and the switch statement. Typically, you use the if statement to evaluate simple conditions with only a few possible outcomes. The switch statement is better suited to more complex conditions with multiple possible permutations and is useful in situations where pattern matching can help select an appropriate code branch to execute.

### If

In its simplest form, the if statement has a single if condition. It executes a set of statements only if that condition is true.

```swift
var temperatureInFahrenheit = 30
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
}
// Prints "It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf."
```

The if statement can provide an alternative set of statements, known as an else clause, for situations when the if condition is false. These statements are indicated by the else keyword.

```swift
temperatureInFahrenheit = 40
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
} else {
    print("It's not that cold. Wear a t-shirt.")
}
// Prints "It's not that cold. Wear a t-shirt."
```

You can chain multiple if statements together to consider additional clauses.

```swift
temperatureInFahrenheit = 90
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
} else if temperatureInFahrenheit >= 86 {
    print("It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen.")
} else {
    print("It's not that cold. Wear a t-shirt.")
}
// Prints "It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen."
```

### Switch

A switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. It then executes an appropriate block of code, based on the first pattern that matches successfully. A switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement for responding to multiple potential states.
  
In its simplest form, a switch statement compares a value against one or more values of the same type.

```
switch some value to consider {
case value 1:
    respond to value 1
case value 2,
     value 3:
    respond to value 2 or 3
default:
    otherwise, do something else
}
```

Every switch statement must be exhaustive. That is, every possible value of the type being considered must be matched by one of the switch cases. If it’s not appropriate to provide a case for every possible value, you can define a default case to cover any values that aren’t addressed explicitly. This default case is indicated by the default keyword, and must always appear last.
  
This example uses a switch statement to consider a single lowercase character called someCharacter:

```swift
let someCharacter: Character = "z"
switch someCharacter {
case "a":
    print("The first letter of the alphabet")
case "z":
    print("The last letter of the alphabet")
default:
    print("Some other character")
}
// Prints "The last letter of the alphabet"
```


### No Implicit Fallthrough

In contrast with switch statements in C and Objective-C, switch statements in Swift don’t fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one by default. Instead, the entire switch statement finishes its execution as soon as the first matching switch case is completed, without requiring an explicit break statement. This makes the switch statement safer and easier to use than the one in C and avoids executing more than one switch case by mistake.

To make a switch with a single case that matches both "a" and "A", combine the two values into a compound case, separating the values with commas.

let anotherCharacter: Character = "a"
switch anotherCharacter {
case "a", "A":
    print("The letter A")
default:
    print("Not the letter A")
}
// Prints "The letter A"

### Interval Matching

Values in switch cases can be checked for their inclusion in an interval. This example uses number intervals to provide a natural-language count for numbers of any size:

```swift
let approximateCount = 62
let countedThings = "moons orbiting Saturn"
let naturalCount: String
switch approximateCount {
case 0:
    naturalCount = "no"
case 1..<5:
    naturalCount = "a few"
case 5..<12:
    naturalCount = "several"
case 12..<100:
    naturalCount = "dozens of"
case 100..<1000:
    naturalCount = "hundreds of"
default:
    naturalCount = "many"
}
print("There are \(naturalCount) \(countedThings).")
// Prints "There are dozens of moons orbiting Saturn."
```

### Tuples

You can use tuples to test multiple values in the same switch statement. Each element of the tuple can be tested against a different value or interval of values. Alternatively, use the underscore character (_), also known as the wildcard pattern, to match any possible value.
  
The example below takes an (x, y) point, expressed as a simple tuple of type (Int, Int), and categorizes it on the graph that follows the example.

```swift
let somePoint = (1, 1)
switch somePoint {
case (0, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is at the origin")
case (_, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the x-axis")
case (0, _):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the y-axis")
case (-2...2, -2...2):
    print("\(somePoint) is inside the box")
default:
    print("\(somePoint) is outside of the box")
}
// Prints "(1, 1) is inside the box"
```

![Tuple](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/coordinateGraphSimple_2x.png)

The switch statement determines whether the point is at the origin (0, 0), on the red x-axis, on the green y-axis, inside the blue 4-by-4 box centered on the origin, or outside of the box.
  
Unlike C, Swift allows multiple switch cases to consider the same value or values. In fact, the point (0, 0) could match all four of the cases in this example. However, if multiple matches are possible, the first matching case is always used. The point (0, 0) would match case (0, 0) first, and so all other matching cases would be ignored.

### Value Bindings

A switch case can name the value or values it matches to temporary constants or variables, for use in the body of the case. This behavior is known as value binding, because the values are bound to temporary constants or variables within the case’s body.
  
The example below takes an (x, y) point, expressed as a tuple of type (Int, Int), and categorizes it on the graph that follows:

```swift
let anotherPoint = (2, 0)
switch anotherPoint {
case (let x, 0):
    print("on the x-axis with an x value of \(x)")
case (0, let y):
    print("on the y-axis with a y value of \(y)")
case let (x, y):
    print("somewhere else at (\(x), \(y))")
}
// Prints "on the x-axis with an x value of 2"
```

![binding](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/coordinateGraphMedium_2x.png)

### Where

A switch case can use a where clause to check for additional conditions.
  
The example below categorizes an (x, y) point on the following graph:

```swift
let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint {
case let (x, y) where x == y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == y")
case let (x, y) where x == -y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == -y")
case let (x, y):
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is just some arbitrary point")
}
// Prints "(1, -1) is on the line x == -y"
```

![where](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/coordinateGraphComplex_2x.png)

### Compound Cases

Multiple switch cases that share the same body can be combined by writing several patterns after case, with a comma between each of the patterns. If any of the patterns match, then the case is considered to match. The patterns can be written over multiple lines if the list is long. For example:

```swift
let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a vowel")
case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m",
     "n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:
    print("\(someCharacter) isn't a vowel or a consonant")
}
// Prints "e is a vowel"
```

Compound cases can also include value bindings. All of the patterns of a compound case have to include the same set of value bindings, and each binding has to get a value of the same type from all of the patterns in the compound case. This ensures that, no matter which part of the compound case matched, the code in the body of the case can always access a value for the bindings and that the value always has the same type.

```swift
let stillAnotherPoint = (9, 0)
switch stillAnotherPoint {
case (let distance, 0), (0, let distance):
    print("On an axis, \(distance) from the origin")
default:
    print("Not on an axis")
}
// Prints "On an axis, 9 from the origin"
```

## Control Transfer Statements

Control transfer statements change the order in which your code is executed, by transferring control from one piece of code to another. Swift has five control transfer statements:

- continue
- break
- fallthrough
- return
- throw

### Continue

The continue statement tells a loop to stop what it’s doing and start again at the beginning of the next iteration through the loop. It says “I am done with the current loop iteration” without leaving the loop altogether.

The following example removes all vowels and spaces from a lowercase string to create a cryptic puzzle phrase:

```swift
let puzzleInput = "great minds think alike"
var puzzleOutput = ""
let charactersToRemove: [Character] = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", " "]
for character in puzzleInput {
    if charactersToRemove.contains(character) {
        continue
    }
    puzzleOutput.append(character)
}
print(puzzleOutput)
// Prints "grtmndsthnklk"
```

### Break

The break statement ends execution of an entire control flow statement immediately. The break statement can be used inside a switch or loop statement when you want to terminate the execution of the switch or loop statement earlier than would otherwise be the case.

### Break in a Loop Statement

When used inside a loop statement, break ends the loop’s execution immediately and transfers control to the code after the loop’s closing brace (}). No further code from the current iteration of the loop is executed, and no further iterations of the loop are started.

### Break in a Switch Statement

When used inside a switch statement, break causes the switch statement to end its execution immediately and to transfer control to the code after the switch statement’s closing brace (}).
  
This behavior can be used to match and ignore one or more cases in a switch statement. Because Swift’s switch statement is exhaustive and doesn’t allow empty cases, it’s sometimes necessary to deliberately match and ignore a case in order to make your intentions explicit. You do this by writing the break statement as the entire body of the case you want to ignore. When that case is matched by the switch statement, the break statement inside the case ends the switch statement’s execution immediately.

### Fallthrough

In Swift, switch statements don’t fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one. That is, the entire switch statement completes its execution as soon as the first matching case is completed. By contrast, C requires you to insert an explicit break statement at the end of every switch case to prevent fallthrough. Avoiding default fallthrough means that Swift switch statements are much more concise and predictable than their counterparts in C, and thus they avoid executing multiple switch cases by mistake.
  
If you need C-style fallthrough behavior, you can opt in to this behavior on a case-by-case basis with the fallthrough keyword. The example below uses fallthrough to create a textual description of a number.

```swift
let integerToDescribe = 5
var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
switch integerToDescribe {
case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
    description += " a prime number, and also"
    fallthrough
default:
    description += " an integer."
}
print(description)
// Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."

```

This example declares a new String variable called description and assigns it an initial value. The function then considers the value of integerToDescribe using a switch statement. If the value of integerToDescribe is one of the prime numbers in the list, the function appends text to the end of description, to note that the number is prime. It then uses the fallthrough keyword to “fall into” the default case as well. The default case adds some extra text to the end of the description, and the switch statement is complete.

### Labeled Statements

To achieve these aims, you can mark a loop statement or conditional statement with a statement label. With a conditional statement, you can use a statement label with the break statement to end the execution of the labeled statement. With a loop statement, you can use a statement label with the break or continue statement to end or continue the execution of the labeled statement.

A labeled statement is indicated by placing a label on the same line as the statement’s introducer keyword, followed by a colon. Here’s an example of this syntax for a while loop, although the principle is the same for all loops and switch statements:

label name: while condition {
    statements
}

The following example uses the break and continue statements with a labeled while loop for an adapted version of the Snakes and Ladders game that you saw earlier in this chapter.

The values of finalSquare, board, square, and diceRoll are initialized in the same way as before:

```
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
```

The while loop’s condition is while square != finalSquare, to reflect that you must land exactly on square 25.

```swift
gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    switch square + diceRoll {
    case finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
        break gameLoop
    case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
        continue gameLoop
    default:
        // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
        square += diceRoll
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
```

## Early Exit

A guard statement, like an if statement, executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. You use a guard statement to require that a condition must be true in order for the code after the guard statement to be executed. Unlike an if statement, a guard statement always has an else clause—the code inside the else clause is executed if the condition isn’t true.

```swift
func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }

    print("Hello \(name)!")

    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }

    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}

greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."
```

If that condition isn’t met, the code inside the else branch is executed. That branch must transfer control to exit the code block in which the guard statement appears. It can do this with a control transfer statement such as return, break, continue, or throw, or it can call a function or method that doesn’t return, such as fatalError(_:file:line:).
  
Using a guard statement for requirements improves the readability of your code, compared to doing the same check with an if statement. It lets you write the code that’s typically executed without wrapping it in an else block, and it lets you keep the code that handles a violated requirement next to the requirement.

## Checking API Availability

Swift has built-in support for checking API availability, which ensures that you don’t accidentally use APIs that are unavailable on a given deployment target.

The compiler uses availability information in the SDK to verify that all of the APIs used in your code are available on the deployment target specified by your project. Swift reports an error at compile time if you try to use an API that isn’t available.

You use an availability condition in an if or guard statement to conditionally execute a block of code, depending on whether the APIs you want to use are available at runtime. The compiler uses the information from the availability condition when it verifies that the APIs in that block of code are available.

```swift
if #available(iOS 10, macOS 10.12, *) {
    // Use iOS 10 APIs on iOS, and use macOS 10.12 APIs on macOS
} else {
    // Fall back to earlier iOS and macOS APIs
}
```

In its general form, the availability condition takes a list of platform names and versions. You use platform names such as iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS—for the full list, see Declaration Attributes. In addition to specifying major version numbers like iOS 8 or macOS 10.10, you can specify minor versions numbers like iOS 11.2.6 and macOS 10.13.3.

```swift
if #available(platform name version, ..., *) {
    statements to execute if the APIs are available
} else {
    fallback statements to execute if the APIs are unavailable
}
```

When you use an availability condition with a guard statement, it refines the availability information that’s used for the rest of the code in that code block.

```swift
@available(macOS 10.12, *)
struct ColorPreference {
    var bestColor = "blue"
}

func chooseBestColor() -> String {
    guard #available(macOS 10.12, *) else {
        return "gray"
    }
    let colors = ColorPreference()
    return colors.bestColor
}
```

In addition to #available, Swift also supports the opposite check using an unavailability condition. For example, the following two checks do the same thing:

```swift
if #available(iOS 10, *) {
} else {
    // Fallback code
}

// same

if #unavailable(iOS 10) {
    // Fallback code
}
```

Using the #unavailable form helps make your code more readable when the check contains only fallback code.
