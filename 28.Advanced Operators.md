# Advanced Operators

Unlike arithmetic operators in C, arithmetic operators in Swift don’t overflow by default.Overflow behavior is trapped and reported as an error. To opt in to overflow behavior, use Swift’s second set of arithmetic operators that overflow by default, such as the overflow addition operator (&+). All of these overflow operators begin with an ampersand (&).
  
When you define your own structures, classes, and enumerations, it can be useful to provide your own implementations of the standard Swift operators for these custom types. Swift makes it easy to provide tailored implementations of these operators and to determine exactly what their behavior should be for each type you create.
  
You’re not limited to the predefined operators. Swift gives you the freedom to define your own custom infix, prefix, postfix, and assignment operators, with custom precedence and associativity values. These operators can be used and adopted in your code like any of the predefined operators, and you can even extend existing types to support the custom operators you define.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators enable you to manipulate the individual raw data bits within a data structure. They’re often used in low-level programming, such as graphics programming and device driver creation. Bitwise operators can also be useful when you work with raw data from external sources, such as encoding and decoding data for communication over a custom protocol.
  
Swift supports all of the bitwise operators found in C, as described below.

### Bitwise NOT Operator

The bitwise NOT operator (~) inverts all bits in a number:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitwiseNOT_2x.png)

The bitwise NOT operator is a prefix operator, and appears immediately before the value it operates on, without any white space:

```swift
let initialBits: UInt8 = 0b00001111
let invertedBits = ~initialBits  // equals 11110000
```

### Bitwise AND Operator

The bitwise AND operator (&) combines the bits of two numbers. It returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if the bits were equal to 1 in both input numbers:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitwiseAND_2x.png)

In the example below, the values of firstSixBits and lastSixBits both have four middle bits equal to 1. The bitwise AND operator combines them to make the number 00111100, which is equal to an unsigned decimal value of 60:

```swift
let firstSixBits: UInt8 = 0b11111100
let lastSixBits: UInt8  = 0b00111111
let middleFourBits = firstSixBits & lastSixBits  // equals 00111100
```

### Bitwise OR Operator

The bitwise OR operator (|) compares the bits of two numbers. The operator returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 if the bits are equal to 1 in either input number:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitwiseOR_2x.png)

In the example below, the values of someBits and moreBits have different bits set to 1. The bitwise OR operator combines them to make the number 11111110, which equals an unsigned decimal of 254:

```swift
let someBits: UInt8 = 0b10110010
let moreBits: UInt8 = 0b01011110
let combinedbits = someBits | moreBits  // equals 11111110
```

### Bitwise XOR Operator

The bitwise XOR operator, or “exclusive OR operator” (^), compares the bits of two numbers. The operator returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 where the input bits are different and are set to 0 where the input bits are the same:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitwiseXOR_2x.png)

In the example below, the values of firstBits and otherBits each have a bit set to 1 in a location that the other does not. The bitwise XOR operator sets both of these bits to 1 in its output value. All of the other bits in firstBits and otherBits match and are set to 0 in the output value:

```swift
let firstBits: UInt8 = 0b00010100
let otherBits: UInt8 = 0b00000101
let outputBits = firstBits ^ otherBits  // equals 00010001
```

### Bitwise Left and Right Shift Operators

The bitwise left shift operator (<<) and bitwise right shift operator (>>) move all bits in a number to the left or the right by a certain number of places, according to the rules defined below.
  
Bitwise left and right shifts have the effect of multiplying or dividing an integer by a factor of two. Shifting an integer’s bits to the left by one position doubles its value, whereas shifting it to the right by one position halves its value.

### Shifting Behavior for Unsigned Integers

The bitwise left shift operator (<<) and bitwise right shift operator (>>) move all bits in a number to the left or the right by a certain number of places, according to the rules defined below.
  
Bitwise left and right shifts have the effect of multiplying or dividing an integer by a factor of two. Shifting an integer’s bits to the left by one position doubles its value, whereas shifting it to the right by one position halves its value.
  
Shifting Behavior for Unsigned Integers  
The bit-shifting behavior for unsigned integers is as follows:

1. Existing bits are moved to the left or right by the requested number of places.
2. Any bits that are moved beyond the bounds of the integer’s storage are discarded.
3. Zeros are inserted in the spaces left behind after the original bits are moved to the left or right.

This approach is known as a logical shift.
  
The illustration below shows the results of 11111111 << 1 (which is 11111111 shifted to the left by 1 place), and 11111111 >> 1 (which is 11111111 shifted to the right by 1 place). Blue numbers are shifted, gray numbers are discarded, and orange zeros are inserted:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitshiftUnsigned_2x.png)

Here’s how bit shifting looks in Swift code:

```swift
let shiftBits: UInt8 = 4   // 00000100 in binary
shiftBits << 1             // 00001000
shiftBits << 2             // 00010000
shiftBits << 5             // 10000000
shiftBits << 6             // 00000000
shiftBits >> 2             // 00000001
```

You can use bit shifting to encode and decode values within other data types:

```swift
let pink: UInt32 = 0xCC6699
let redComponent = (pink & 0xFF0000) >> 16    // redComponent is 0xCC, or 204
let greenComponent = (pink & 0x00FF00) >> 8   // greenComponent is 0x66, or 102
let blueComponent = pink & 0x0000FF           // blueComponent is 0x99, or 153
```

### Shifting Behavior for Signed Integers

The shifting behavior is more complex for signed integers than for unsigned integers, because of the way signed integers are represented in binary. (The examples below are based on 8-bit signed integers for simplicity, but the same principles apply for signed integers of any size.)
  
Signed integers use their first bit (known as the sign bit) to indicate whether the integer is positive or negative. A sign bit of 0 means positive, and a sign bit of 1 means negative.
  
The remaining bits (known as the value bits) store the actual value. Positive numbers are stored in exactly the same way as for unsigned integers, counting upwards from 0. Here’s how the bits inside an Int8 look for the number 4:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitshiftSignedFour_2x.png)

The sign bit is 0 (meaning “positive”), and the seven value bits are just the number 4, written in binary notation.
  
Here’s how the bits inside an Int8 look for the number -4:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitshiftSignedMinusFour_2x.png)

This time, the sign bit is 1 (meaning “negative”), and the seven value bits have a binary value of 124 (which is 128 - 4):

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitshiftSignedMinusFourValue_2x.png)

This encoding for negative numbers is known as a two’s complement representation. It may seem an unusual way to represent negative numbers, but it has several advantages.
  
First, you can add -1 to -4, simply by performing a standard binary addition of all eight bits (including the sign bit), and discarding anything that doesn’t fit in the eight bits once you’re done:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/bitshiftSignedAddition_2x.png)

## Overflow Operators

If you try to insert a number into an integer constant or variable that can’t hold that value, by default Swift reports an error rather than allowing an invalid value to be created. This behavior gives extra safety when you work with numbers that are too large or too small.

For example, the Int16 integer type can hold any signed integer between -32768 and 32767. Trying to set an Int16 constant or variable to a number outside of this range causes an error:

```swift
var potentialOverflow = Int16.max
// potentialOverflow equals 32767, which is the maximum value an Int16 can hold
potentialOverflow += 1
// this causes an error
```

However, when you specifically want an overflow condition to truncate the number of available bits, you can opt in to this behavior rather than triggering an error. Swift provides three arithmetic overflow operators that opt in to the overflow behavior for integer calculations. These operators all begin with an ampersand (&):

- Overflow addition (&+)
- Overflow subtraction (&-)
- Overflow multiplication (&*)

### Value Overflow

Numbers can overflow in both the positive and negative direction.

Here’s an example of what happens when an unsigned integer is allowed to overflow in the positive direction, using the overflow addition operator (&+):

```swift
var unsignedOverflow = UInt8.max
// unsignedOverflow equals 255, which is the maximum value a UInt8 can hold
unsignedOverflow = unsignedOverflow &+ 1
// unsignedOverflow is now equal to 0
```

The value that remains within the bounds of the UInt8 after the overflow addition is 00000000, or zero.

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/overflowAddition_2x.png)

Something similar happens when an unsigned integer is allowed to overflow in the negative direction. Here’s an example using the overflow subtraction operator (&-):

```swift
var unsignedOverflow = UInt8.min
// unsignedOverflow equals 0, which is the minimum value a UInt8 can hold
unsignedOverflow = unsignedOverflow &- 1
// unsignedOverflow is now equal to 255
```

The minimum value that a UInt8 can hold is zero, or 00000000 in binary. If you subtract 1 from 00000000 using the overflow subtraction operator (&-), the number will overflow and wrap around to 11111111, or 255 in decimal.

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/overflowUnsignedSubtraction_2x.png)

```swift
var signedOverflow = Int8.min
// signedOverflow equals -128, which is the minimum value an Int8 can hold
signedOverflow = signedOverflow &- 1
// signedOverflow is now equal to 127
```

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/overflowSignedSubtraction_2x.png)

## Precedence and Associativity

Operator precedence gives some operators higher priority than others; these operators are applied first.
  
Operator associativity defines how operators of the same precedence are grouped together—either grouped from the left, or grouped from the right. Think of it as meaning “they associate with the expression to their left,” or “they associate with the expression to their right.”
  
It’s important to consider each operator’s precedence and associativity when working out the order in which a compound expression will be calculated. For example, operator precedence explains why the following expression equals 17.

```swift
2 + 3 % 4 * 5
// this equals 17
```

 In Swift, as in C, the remainder operator (%) and the multiplication operator (*) have a higher precedence than the addition operator (+). As a result, they’re both evaluated before the addition is considered.
  
Remainder and multiplication both associate with the expression to their left. Think of this as adding implicit parentheses around these parts of the expression, starting from their left:
  
> 2 + ((3%4) * 5)
  
(3 % 4) is 3, so this is equivalent to:
  
> 2 + (3 * 5)
  
(3 * 5) is 15, so this is equivalent to:
  
> 2 + 15

This calculation yields the final answer of 17.

## Operator Methods

Classes and structures can provide their own implementations of existing operators. This is known as overloading the existing operators.
  
The example below shows how to implement the arithmetic addition operator (+) for a custom structure. The arithmetic addition operator is a binary operator because it operates on two targets and it’s an infix operator because it appears between those two targets.
  
The example defines a Vector2D structure for a two-dimensional position vector (x, y), followed by a definition of an operator method to add together instances of the Vector2D structure:

```swift
struct Vector2D {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}

extension Vector2D {
    static func + (left: Vector2D, right: Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        return Vector2D(x: left.x + right.x, y: left.y + right.y)
    }
}
```

The type method can be used as an infix operator between existing Vector2D instances:

```swift
let vector = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 1.0)
let anotherVector = Vector2D(x: 2.0, y: 4.0)
let combinedVector = vector + anotherVector
// combinedVector is a Vector2D instance with values of (5.0, 5.0)
```

This example adds together the vectors (3.0, 1.0) and (2.0, 4.0) to make the vector (5.0, 5.0), as illustrated below.

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/vectorAddition_2x.png)

### Prefix and Postfix Operators

The example shown above demonstrates a custom implementation of a binary infix operator. Classes and structures can also provide implementations of the standard unary operators. Unary operators operate on a single target. They’re prefix if they precede their target (such as -a) and postfix operators if they follow their target (such as b!).
  
You implement a prefix or postfix unary operator by writing the prefix or postfix modifier before the func keyword when declaring the operator method:

```swift
extension Vector2D {
    static prefix func - (vector: Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        return Vector2D(x: -vector.x, y: -vector.y)
    }
}
```

For simple numeric values, the unary minus operator converts positive numbers into their negative equivalent and vice versa. The corresponding implementation for Vector2D instances performs this operation on both the x and y properties:

```swift
let positive = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 4.0)
let negative = -positive
// negative is a Vector2D instance with values of (-3.0, -4.0)
let alsoPositive = -negative
// alsoPositive is a Vector2D instance with values of (3.0, 4.0)
```

### Compound Assignment Operators

Compound assignment operators combine assignment (=) with another operation. For example, the addition assignment operator (+=) combines addition and assignment into a single operation. You mark a compound assignment operator’s left input parameter type as inout, because the parameter’s value will be modified directly from within the operator method.
  
The example below implements an addition assignment operator method for Vector2D instances:

```swift
extension Vector2D {
    static func += (left: inout Vector2D, right: Vector2D) {
        left = left + right
    }
}
```

Because an addition operator was defined earlier, you don’t need to reimplement the addition process here. Instead, the addition assignment operator method takes advantage of the existing addition operator method, and uses it to set the left value to be the left value plus the right value:

```swift
var original = Vector2D(x: 1.0, y: 2.0)
let vectorToAdd = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 4.0)
original += vectorToAdd
// original now has values of (4.0, 6.0)
```

### Equivalence Operators

By default, custom classes and structures don’t have an implementation of the equivalence operators, known as the equal to operator (==) and not equal to operator (!=). You usually implement the == operator, and use the standard library’s default implementation of the != operator that negates the result of the == operator. There are two ways to implement the == operator: You can implement it yourself, or for many types, you can ask Swift to synthesize an implementation for you. In both cases, you add conformance to the standard library’s Equatable protocol.
  
You provide an implementation of the == operator in the same way as you implement other infix operators:

```swift
extension Vector2D: Equatable {
    static func == (left: Vector2D, right: Vector2D) -> Bool {
        return (left.x == right.x) && (left.y == right.y)
    }
}
```

The example above implements an == operator to check whether two Vector2D instances have equivalent values. In the context of Vector2D, it makes sense to consider “equal” as meaning “both instances have the same x values and y values”, and so this is the logic used by the operator implementation.

You can now use this operator to check whether two Vector2D instances are equivalent:

```swift
let twoThree = Vector2D(x: 2.0, y: 3.0)
let anotherTwoThree = Vector2D(x: 2.0, y: 3.0)
if twoThree == anotherTwoThree {
    print("These two vectors are equivalent.")
}
// Prints "These two vectors are equivalent."
```

## Custom Operators

You can declare and implement your own custom operators in addition to the standard operators provided by Swift. For a list of characters that can be used to define custom operators, see Operators.
  
New operators are declared at a global level using the operator keyword, and are marked with the prefix, infix or postfix modifiers:

```swift
prefix operator +++
```

The example above defines a new prefix operator called +++. This operator doesn’t have an existing meaning in Swift, and so it’s given its own custom meaning below in the specific context of working with Vector2D instances. For the purposes of this example, +++ is treated as a new “prefix doubling” operator. It doubles the x and y values of a Vector2D instance, by adding the vector to itself with the addition assignment operator defined earlier. To implement the +++ operator, you add a type method called +++ to Vector2D as follows:

```swift
extension Vector2D {
    static prefix func +++ (vector: inout Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        vector += vector
        return vector
    }
}

var toBeDoubled = Vector2D(x: 1.0, y: 4.0)
let afterDoubling = +++toBeDoubled
// toBeDoubled now has values of (2.0, 8.0)
// afterDoubling also has values of (2.0, 8.0)
```

### Precedence for Custom Infix Operators

A custom infix operator that isn’t explicitly placed into a precedence group is given a default precedence group with a precedence immediately higher than the precedence of the ternary conditional operator.

The following example defines a new custom infix operator called +-, which belongs to the precedence group AdditionPrecedence:

```swift
infix operator +-: AdditionPrecedence
extension Vector2D {
    static func +- (left: Vector2D, right: Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        return Vector2D(x: left.x + right.x, y: left.y - right.y)
    }
}
let firstVector = Vector2D(x: 1.0, y: 2.0)
let secondVector = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 4.0)
let plusMinusVector = firstVector +- secondVector
// plusMinusVector is a Vector2D instance with values of (4.0, -2.0)
```

## Result Builders

A result builder is a type you define that adds syntax for creating nested data, like a list or tree, in a natural, declarative way. The code that uses the result builder can include ordinary Swift syntax, like if and for, to handle conditional or repeated pieces of data.

The code below defines a few types for drawing on a single line using stars and text.

```swift
protocol Drawable {
    func draw() -> String
}
struct Line: Drawable {
    var elements: [Drawable]
    func draw() -> String {
        return elements.map { $0.draw() }.joined(separator: "")
    }
}
struct Text: Drawable {
    var content: String
    init(_ content: String) { self.content = content }
    func draw() -> String { return content }
}
struct Space: Drawable {
    func draw() -> String { return " " }
}
struct Stars: Drawable {
    var length: Int
    func draw() -> String { return String(repeating: "*", count: length) }
}
struct AllCaps: Drawable {
    var content: Drawable
    func draw() -> String { return content.draw().uppercased() }
}
```

It’s possible to make a drawing with these types by calling their initializers:

```swift
let name: String? = "Ravi Patel"
let manualDrawing = Line(elements: [
    Stars(length: 3),
    Text("Hello"),
    Space(),
    AllCaps(content: Text((name ?? "World") + "!")),
    Stars(length: 2),
    ])
print(manualDrawing.draw())
// Prints "***Hello RAVI PATEL!**"
```

 If you needed to include switches or for loops to build up part of the drawing, there’s no way to do that. A result builder lets you rewrite code like this so that it looks like normal Swift code.
  
To define a result builder, you write the @resultBuilder attribute on a type declaration. For example, this code defines a result builder called DrawingBuilder, which lets you use a declarative syntax to describe a drawing:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct DrawingBuilder {
    static func buildBlock(_ components: Drawable...) -> Drawable {
        return Line(elements: components)
    }
    static func buildEither(first: Drawable) -> Drawable {
        return first
    }
    static func buildEither(second: Drawable) -> Drawable {
        return second
    }
}
```

You can apply the @DrawingBuilder attribute to a function’s parameter, which turns a closure passed to the function into the value that the result builder creates from that closure. For example:

```swift
func draw(@DrawingBuilder content: () -> Drawable) -> Drawable {
    return content()
}
func caps(@DrawingBuilder content: () -> Drawable) -> Drawable {
    return AllCaps(content: content())
}

func makeGreeting(for name: String? = nil) -> Drawable {
    let greeting = draw {
        Stars(length: 3)
        Text("Hello")
        Space()
        caps {
            if let name = name {
                Text(name + "!")
            } else {
                Text("World!")
            }
        }
        Stars(length: 2)
    }
    return greeting
}
let genericGreeting = makeGreeting()
print(genericGreeting.draw())
// Prints "***Hello WORLD!**"

let personalGreeting = makeGreeting(for: "Ravi Patel")
print(personalGreeting.draw())
// Prints "***Hello RAVI PATEL!**"
```

When you call those functions, you use the special syntax that DrawingBuilder defines. Swift transforms that declarative description of a drawing into a series of calls to the methods on DrawingBuilder to build up the value that’s passed as the function argument. For example, Swift transforms the call to caps(_:) in that example into code like the following:

```swift
let capsDrawing = caps {
    let partialDrawing: Drawable
    if let name = name {
        let text = Text(name + "!")
        partialDrawing = DrawingBuilder.buildEither(first: text)
    } else {
        let text = Text("World!")
        partialDrawing = DrawingBuilder.buildEither(second: text)
    }
    return partialDrawing
}
```

Although you don’t call these methods in your own code, showing the result of the transformation makes it easier to see how Swift transforms your code when you use the DrawingBuilder syntax.
  
To add support for writing for loops in the special drawing syntax, add a buildArray(_:) method.

```swift
extension DrawingBuilder {
    static func buildArray(_ components: [Drawable]) -> Drawable {
        return Line(elements: components)
    }
}
let manyStars = draw {
    Text("Stars:")
    for length in 1...3 {
        Space()
        Stars(length: length)
    }
}
```

In the code above, the for loop creates an array of drawings, and the buildArray(_:) method turns that array into a Line.
