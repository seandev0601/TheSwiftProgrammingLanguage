# Generics

**Generic code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define.** You can write code that avoids duplication and expresses its intent in a clear, abstracted manner.
  
Generics are one of the most powerful features of Swift, and much of the Swift standard library is built with generic code. In fact, you’ve been using generics throughout the Language Guide, even if you didn’t realize it. 
  
For example, Swift’s Array and Dictionary types are both generic collections. You can create an array that holds Int values, or an array that holds String values, or indeed an array for any other type that can be created in Swift.

## The Problem That Generics Solve

Here’s a standard, nongeneric function called swapTwoInts(_:_:), which swaps two Int values:

```swift
func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}
```

The swapTwoInts(_:_:) function swaps the original value of b into a, and the original value of a into b. You can call this function to swap the values in two Int variables:

```swift
var someInt = 3
var anotherInt = 107
swapTwoInts(&someInt, &anotherInt)
print("someInt is now \(someInt), and anotherInt is now \(anotherInt)")
// Prints "someInt is now 107, and anotherInt is now 3"
```

The swapTwoInts(_:_:) function is useful, but it can only be used with Int values. If you want to swap two String values, or two Double values, you have to write more functions, such as the swapTwoStrings(_:_:) and swapTwoDoubles(_:_:) functions shown below:

```swift
func swapTwoStrings(_ a: inout String, _ b: inout String) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}

func swapTwoDoubles(_ a: inout Double, _ b: inout Double) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}
```

It’s more useful, and considerably more flexible, to write a single function that swaps two values of any type. Generic code enables you to write such a function.

## Generic Functions

Generic functions can work with any type. Here’s a generic version of the swapTwoInts(_:_:) function from above, called swapTwoValues(_:_:):

```swift
func swapTwoValues<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}
```

The generic version of the function uses a placeholder type name (called T, in this case) instead of an actual type name (such as Int, String, or Double). The placeholder type name doesn’t say anything about what T must be, but it does say that both a and b must be of the same type T, whatever T represents. The actual type to use in place of T is determined each time the swapTwoValues(_:_:) function is called.
  
The other difference between a generic function and a nongeneric function is that the generic function’s name (swapTwoValues(_:_:)) is followed by the placeholder type name (T) inside angle brackets (<T>). The brackets tell Swift that T is a placeholder type name within the swapTwoValues(_:_:) function definition. Because T is a placeholder, Swift doesn’t look for an actual type called T.
  
In the two examples below, T is inferred to be Int and String respectively:

```swift
var someInt = 3
var anotherInt = 107
swapTwoValues(&someInt, &anotherInt)
// someInt is now 107, and anotherInt is now 3

var someString = "hello"
var anotherString = "world"
swapTwoValues(&someString, &anotherString)
// someString is now "world", and anotherString is now "hello"
```

## Type Parameters

In the swapTwoValues(_:_:) example above, the placeholder type T is an example of a type parameter. Type parameters specify and name a placeholder type, and are written immediately after the function’s name, between a pair of matching angle brackets (such as <T>).
  
Once you specify a type parameter, you can use it to define the type of a function’s parameters (such as the a and b parameters of the swapTwoValues(_:_:) function), or as the function’s return type, or as a type annotation within the body of the function. In each case, the type parameter is replaced with an actual type whenever the function is called. (In the swapTwoValues(_:_:) example above, T was replaced with Int the first time the function was called, and was replaced with String the second time it was called.)

## Naming Type Parameters

In most cases, type parameters have descriptive names, such as Key and Value in Dictionary<Key, Value> and Element in Array<Element>, which tells the reader about the relationship between the type parameter and the generic type or function it’s used in. However, when there isn’t a meaningful relationship between them, it’s traditional to name them using single letters such as T, U, and V, such as T in the swapTwoValues(_:_:) function above.

## Generic Types

In addition to generic functions, Swift enables you to define your own generic types. These are custom classes, structures, and enumerations that can work with any type, in a similar way to Array and Dictionary.
  
This section shows you how to write a generic collection type called Stack. A stack is an ordered set of values, similar to an array, but with a more restricted set of operations than Swift’s Array type. An array allows new items to be inserted and removed at any location in the array. A stack, however, allows new items to be appended only to the end of the collection (known as pushing a new value on to the stack). Similarly, a stack allows items to be removed only from the end of the collection (known as popping a value off the stack).
  
The illustration below shows the push and pop behavior for a stack:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/stackPushPop_2x.png)

1. There are currently three values on the stack.
2. A fourth value is pushed onto the top of the stack.
3. The stack now holds four values, with the most recent one at the top.
4. The top item in the stack is popped.
5. After popping a value, the stack once again holds three values.

Here’s how to write a nongeneric version of a stack, in this case for a stack of Int values:

```swift
struct IntStack {
    var items: [Int] = []
    mutating func push(_ item: Int) {
        items.append(item)
    }
    mutating func pop() -> Int {
        return items.removeLast()
    }
}
```

The IntStack type shown above can only be used with Int values, however. It would be much more useful to define a generic Stack structure, that can manage a stack of any type of value.

```swift
Here’s a generic version of the same code:

struct Stack<Element> {
    var items: [Element] = []
    mutating func push(_ item: Element) {
        items.append(item)
    }
    mutating func pop() -> Element {
        return items.removeLast()
    }
}
```

In this case, Element is used as a placeholder in three places:

- To create a property called items, which is initialized with an empty array of values of type Element
- To specify that the push(_:) method has a single parameter called item, which must be of type Element
- To specify that the value returned by the pop() method will be a value of type Element

Because it’s a generic type, Stack can be used to create a stack of any valid type in Swift, in a similar manner to Array and Dictionary.
  
For example, to create a new stack of strings, you write Stack<String>():

```swift
var stackOfStrings = Stack<String>()
stackOfStrings.push("uno")
stackOfStrings.push("dos")
stackOfStrings.push("tres")
stackOfStrings.push("cuatro")
// the stack now contains 4 strings
```

Here’s how stackOfStrings looks after pushing these four values on to the stack:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/stackPushedFourStrings_2x.png)

Popping a value from the stack removes and returns the top value, "cuatro":

```swift
let fromTheTop = stackOfStrings.pop()
// fromTheTop is equal to "cuatro", and the stack now contains 3 strings
```

Here’s how the stack looks after popping its top value:

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/stackPoppedOneString_2x.png)

## Extending a Generic Type

When you extend a generic type, you don’t provide a type parameter list as part of the extension’s definition. Instead, the type parameter list from the original type definition is available within the body of the extension, and the original type parameter names are used to refer to the type parameters from the original definition.
  
The following example extends the generic Stack type to add a read-only computed property called topItem, which returns the top item on the stack without popping it from the stack:

```swift
extension Stack {
    var topItem: Element? {
        return items.isEmpty ? nil : items[items.count - 1]
    }
}
```

Note that this extension doesn’t define a type parameter list. Instead, the Stack type’s existing type parameter name, Element, is used within the extension to indicate the optional type of the topItem computed property.

The topItem computed property can now be used with any Stack instance to access and query its top item without removing it.

```swift
if let topItem = stackOfStrings.topItem {
    print("The top item on the stack is \(topItem).")
}
// Prints "The top item on the stack is tres."
```

## Type Constraints

Type constraints specify that a type parameter must inherit from a specific class, or conform to a particular protocol or protocol composition.
  
For example, Swift’s Dictionary type places a limitation on the types that can be used as keys for a dictionary. As described in Dictionaries, the type of a dictionary’s keys must be hashable. That is, it must provide a way to make itself uniquely representable. Dictionary needs its keys to be hashable so that it can check whether it already contains a value for a particular key. Without this requirement, Dictionary couldn’t tell whether it should insert or replace a value for a particular key, nor would it be able to find a value for a given key that’s already in the dictionary.
  
You can define your own type constraints when creating custom generic types, and these constraints provide much of the power of generic programming. Abstract concepts like Hashable characterize types in terms of their conceptual characteristics, rather than their concrete type.

### Type Constraint Syntax

You write type constraints by placing a single class or protocol constraint after a type parameter’s name, separated by a colon, as part of the type parameter list. The basic syntax for type constraints on a generic function is shown below (although the syntax is the same for generic types):

```swift
func someFunction<T: SomeClass, U: SomeProtocol>(someT: T, someU: U) {
    // function body goes here
}
```

The hypothetical function above has two type parameters. The first type parameter, T, has a type constraint that requires T to be a subclass of SomeClass. The second type parameter, U, has a type constraint that requires U to conform to the protocol SomeProtocol.

### Type Constraints in Action

Here’s a nongeneric function called findIndex(ofString:in:), which is given a String value to find and an array of String values within which to find it. The findIndex(ofString:in:) function returns an optional Int value, which will be the index of the first matching string in the array if it’s found, or nil if the string can’t be found:

```swift
func findIndex(ofString valueToFind: String, in array: [String]) -> Int? {
    for (index, value) in array.enumerated() {
        if value == valueToFind {
            return index
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

The findIndex(ofString:in:) function can be used to find a string value in an array of strings:

```swift
let strings = ["cat", "dog", "llama", "parakeet", "terrapin"]
if let foundIndex = findIndex(ofString: "llama", in: strings) {
    print("The index of llama is \(foundIndex)")
}
// Prints "The index of llama is 2"
```

You can write the same functionality as a generic function by replacing any mention of strings with values of some type T instead.
  
Here’s how you might expect a generic version of findIndex(ofString:in:), called findIndex(of:in:), to be written. Note that the return type of this function is still Int?, because the function returns an optional index number, not an optional value from the array. Be warned, though—this function doesn’t compile, for reasons explained after the example:

```swift
func findIndex<T>(of valueToFind: T, in array:[T]) -> Int? {
    for (index, value) in array.enumerated() {
        if value == valueToFind {
            return index
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

This function doesn’t compile as written above. The problem lies with the equality check, “if value == valueToFind”. Not every type in Swift can be compared with the equal to operator (==). If you create your own class or structure to represent a complex data model, for example, then the meaning of “equal to” for that class or structure isn’t something that Swift can guess for you. Because of this, it isn’t possible to guarantee that this code will work for every possible type T, and an appropriate error is reported when you try to compile the code.
  
All is not lost, however. The Swift standard library defines a protocol called Equatable, which requires any conforming type to implement the equal to operator (==) and the not equal to operator (!=) to compare any two values of that type. All of Swift’s standard types automatically support the Equatable protocol.
  
Any type that’s Equatable can be used safely with the findIndex(of:in:) function, because it’s guaranteed to support the equal to operator. To express this fact, you write a type constraint of `Equatable` as part of the type parameter’s definition when you define the function:

```swift
func findIndex<T: Equatable>(of valueToFind: T, in array:[T]) -> Int? {
    for (index, value) in array.enumerated() {
        if value == valueToFind {
            return index
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

The single type parameter for findIndex(of:in:) is written as T: Equatable, which means “any type T that conforms to the Equatable protocol.”
  
The findIndex(of:in:) function now compiles successfully and can be used with any type that’s Equatable, such as Double or String:

```swift
let doubleIndex = findIndex(of: 9.3, in: [3.14159, 0.1, 0.25])
// doubleIndex is an optional Int with no value, because 9.3 isn't in the array
let stringIndex = findIndex(of: "Andrea", in: ["Mike", "Malcolm", "Andrea"])
// stringIndex is an optional Int containing a value of 2
```

## Associated types

When defining a protocol, it’s sometimes useful to declare one or more associated types as part of the protocol’s definition. An associated type gives a placeholder name to a type that’s used as part of the protocol. The actual type to use for that associated type isn’t specified until the protocol is adopted. Associated types are specified with the associatedtype keyword.

### Associated Types in Action

Here’s an example of a protocol called Container, which declares an associated type called Item:

```swift
protocol Container {
    associatedtype Item
    mutating func append(_ item: Item)
    var count: Int { get }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Item { get }
}
```

The Container protocol defines three required capabilities that any container must provide:

- It must be possible to add a new item to the container with an append(_:) method.
- It must be possible to access a count of the items in the container through a count property that returns an Int value.
- It must be possible to retrieve each item in the container with a subscript that takes an Int index value.

This protocol doesn’t specify how the items in the container should be stored or what type they’re allowed to be. The protocol only specifies the three bits of functionality that any type must provide in order to be considered a Container. A conforming type can provide additional functionality, as long as it satisfies these three requirements.
  
Any type that conforms to the Container protocol must be able to specify the type of values it stores. Specifically, it must ensure that only items of the right type are added to the container, and it must be clear about the type of the items returned by its subscript.
  
To achieve this, the Container protocol declares an associated type called Item, written as associatedtype Item. The protocol doesn’t define what Item is—that information is left for any conforming type to provide. Nonetheless, the Item alias provides a way to refer to the type of the items in a Container, and to define a type for use with the append(_:) method and subscript, to ensure that the expected behavior of any Container is enforced.
  
Here’s a version of the nongeneric IntStack type from Generic Types above, adapted to conform to the Container protocol:

```swift
struct IntStack: Container {
    // original IntStack implementation
    var items: [Int] = []
    mutating func push(_ item: Int) {
        items.append(item)
    }
    mutating func pop() -> Int {
        return items.removeLast()
    }
    // conformance to the Container protocol
    typealias Item = Int
    mutating func append(_ item: Int) {
        self.push(item)
    }
    var count: Int {
        return items.count
    }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Int {
        return items[i]
    }
}
```

The IntStack type implements all three of the Container protocol’s requirements, and in each case wraps part of the IntStack type’s existing functionality to satisfy these requirements.
  
You can also make the generic Stack type conform to the Container protocol:

```swift
struct Stack<Element>: Container {
    // original Stack<Element> implementation
    var items: [Element] = []
    mutating func push(_ item: Element) {
        items.append(item)
    }
    mutating func pop() -> Element {
        return items.removeLast()
    }
    // conformance to the Container protocol
    mutating func append(_ item: Element) {
        self.push(item)
    }
    var count: Int {
        return items.count
    }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Element {
        return items[i]
    }
}
```

### Extending an Existing Type to Specify an Associated Type

Swift’s Array type already provides an append(_:) method, a count property, and a subscript with an Int index to retrieve its elements. These three capabilities match the requirements of the Container protocol. This means that you can extend Array to conform to the Container protocol simply by declaring that Array adopts the protocol. You do this with an empty extension, as described in Declaring Protocol Adoption with an Extension:

```swift
extension Array: Container {}

```

Array’s existing append(_:) method and subscript enable Swift to infer the appropriate type to use for Item, just as for the generic Stack type above. After defining this extension, you can use any Array as a Container.

### Adding Constraints to an Associated Type

You can add type constraints to an associated type in a protocol to require that conforming types satisfy those constraints. For example, the following code defines a version of Container that requires the items in the container to be equatable.

```swift
protocol Container {
    associatedtype Item: Equatable
    mutating func append(_ item: Item)
    var count: Int { get }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Item { get }
}
```

To conform to this version of Container, the container’s Item type has to conform to the Equatable protocol.

### Using a Protocol in Its Associated Type’s Constraints

A protocol can appear as part of its own requirements. For example, here’s a protocol that refines the Container protocol, adding the requirement of a suffix(_:) method. The suffix(_:) method returns a given number of elements from the end of the container, storing them in an instance of the Suffix type.

```swift
protocol SuffixableContainer: Container {
    associatedtype Suffix: SuffixableContainer where Suffix.Item == Item
    func suffix(_ size: Int) -> Suffix
}
```

In this protocol, Suffix is an associated type, like the Item type in the Container example above. Suffix has two constraints: It must conform to the SuffixableContainer protocol (the protocol currently being defined), and its Item type must be the same as the container’s Item type. 
  
Here’s an extension of the Stack type from Generic Types above that adds conformance to the SuffixableContainer protocol:

```swift
extension Stack: SuffixableContainer {
    func suffix(_ size: Int) -> Stack {
        var result = Stack()
        for index in (count-size)..<count {
            result.append(self[index])
        }
        return result
    }
    // Inferred that Suffix is Stack.
}
var stackOfInts = Stack<Int>()
stackOfInts.append(10)
stackOfInts.append(20)
stackOfInts.append(30)
let suffix = stackOfInts.suffix(2)
// suffix contains 20 and 30
```

In the example above, the Suffix associated type for Stack is also Stack, so the suffix operation on Stack returns another Stack. Alternatively, a type that conforms to SuffixableContainer can have a Suffix type that’s different from itself—meaning the suffix operation can return a different type. 
  
For example, here’s an extension to the nongeneric IntStack type that adds SuffixableContainer conformance, using Stack<Int> as its suffix type instead of IntStack:

```swift
extension IntStack: SuffixableContainer {
    func suffix(_ size: Int) -> Stack<Int> {
        var result = Stack<Int>()
        for index in (count-size)..<count {
            result.append(self[index])
        }
        return result
    }
    // Inferred that Suffix is Stack<Int>.
}
```

## Generic Where Clauses

In the example above, the Suffix associated type for Stack is also Stack, so the suffix operation on Stack returns another Stack. Alternatively, a type that conforms to SuffixableContainer can have a Suffix type that’s different from itself—meaning the suffix operation can return a different type. For example, here’s an extension to the nongeneric IntStack type that adds SuffixableContainer conformance, using Stack<Int> as its suffix type instead of IntStack:

extension IntStack: SuffixableContainer {
    func suffix(_ size: Int) -> Stack<Int> {
        var result = Stack<Int>()
        for index in (count-size)..<count {
            result.append(self[index])
        }
        return result
    }
    // Inferred that Suffix is Stack<Int>.
}
Generic Where Clauses
Type constraints, as described in Type Constraints, enable you to define requirements on the type parameters associated with a generic function, subscript, or type.
  
It can also be useful to define requirements for associated types. You do this by defining a generic where clause. 
  
- A generic where clause enables you to require that an associated type must conform to a certain protocol, or that certain type parameters and associated types must be the same. 
- A generic where clause starts with the where keyword, followed by constraints for associated types or equality relationships between types and associated types.
- You write a generic where clause right before the opening curly brace of a type or function’s body.

The example below defines a generic function called allItemsMatch, which checks to see if two Container instances contain the same items in the same order. The function returns a Boolean value of true if all items match and a value of false if they don’t.

The two containers to be checked don’t have to be the same type of container (although they can be), but they do have to hold the same type of items. This requirement is expressed through a combination of type constraints and a generic where clause:

```swift
func allItemsMatch<C1: Container, C2: Container>
    (_ someContainer: C1, _ anotherContainer: C2) -> Bool
    where C1.Item == C2.Item, C1.Item: Equatable {

        // Check that both containers contain the same number of items.
        if someContainer.count != anotherContainer.count {
            return false
        }

        // Check each pair of items to see if they're equivalent.
        for i in 0..<someContainer.count {
            if someContainer[i] != anotherContainer[i] {
                return false
            }
        }

        // All items match, so return true.
        return true
}
```

The following requirements are placed on the function’s two type parameters:

- C1 must conform to the Container protocol (written as C1: Container).
- C2 must also conform to the Container protocol (written as C2: Container).
- The Item for C1 must be the same as the Item for C2 (written as C1.Item == C2.Item).
- The Item for C1 must conform to the Equatable protocol (written as C1.Item: Equatable).

The **first and second** requirements are **defined in the function’s type parameter list**, and the **third and fourth** requirements are **defined in the function’s generic where clause**.
  
These requirements mean:

- someContainer is a container of type C1.
- anotherContainer is a container of type C2.
- someContainer and anotherContainer contain the same type of items.
- The items in someContainer can be checked with the not equal operator (!=) to see if they’re different from each other.

The third and fourth requirements combine to mean that the items in anotherContainer can also be checked with the != operator, because they’re exactly the same type as the items in someContainer.
    
Here’s how the allItemsMatch(_:_:) function looks in action:

```swift
var stackOfStrings = Stack<String>()
stackOfStrings.push("uno")
stackOfStrings.push("dos")
stackOfStrings.push("tres")

var arrayOfStrings = ["uno", "dos", "tres"]

if allItemsMatch(stackOfStrings, arrayOfStrings) {
    print("All items match.")
} else {
    print("Not all items match.")
}
// Prints "All items match."
```

The example above creates a Stack instance to store String values, and pushes three strings onto the stack. The example also creates an Array instance initialized with an array literal containing the same three strings as the stack. Even though the stack and the array are of a different type, they both conform to the Container protocol, and both contain the same type of values. You can therefore call the allItemsMatch(_:_:) function with these two containers as its arguments. In the example above, the allItemsMatch(_:_:) function correctly reports that all of the items in the two containers match.

## Extensions with a Generic Where Clause

You can also use a generic where clause as part of an extension. The example below extends the generic Stack structure from the previous examples to add an isTop(_:) method.

```swift
extension Stack where Element: Equatable {
    func isTop(_ item: Element) -> Bool {
        guard let topItem = items.last else {
            return false
        }
        return topItem == item
    }
}
```

This new isTop(_:) method first checks that the stack isn’t empty, and then compares the given item against the stack’s topmost item. If you tried to do this without a generic where clause, you would have a problem: The implementation of isTop(_:) uses the == operator, but the definition of Stack doesn’t require its items to be equatable, so using the == operator results in a compile-time error. Using a generic where clause lets you add a new requirement to the extension, so that the extension adds the isTop(_:) method only when the items in the stack are equatable.
  
Here’s how the isTop(_:) method looks in action:

```swift
if stackOfStrings.isTop("tres") {
    print("Top element is tres.")
} else {
    print("Top element is something else.")
}
// Prints "Top element is tres."
```

If you try to call the isTop(_:) method on a stack whose elements aren’t equatable, you’ll get a compile-time error.

```swift
struct NotEquatable { }
var notEquatableStack = Stack<NotEquatable>()
let notEquatableValue = NotEquatable()
notEquatableStack.push(notEquatableValue)
notEquatableStack.isTop(notEquatableValue)  // Error
```

You can use a generic where clause with extensions to a protocol. The example below extends the Container protocol from the previous examples to add a startsWith(_:) method.

```swift
extension Container where Item: Equatable {
    func startsWith(_ item: Item) -> Bool {
        return count >= 1 && self[0] == item
    }
}
```

This new startsWith(_:) method can be used with any type that conforms to the Container protocol, including the stacks and arrays used above, as long as the container’s items are equatable.

```swift
if [9, 9, 9].startsWith(42) {
    print("Starts with 42.")
} else {
    print("Starts with something else.")
}
// Prints "Starts with something else."
```

The generic where clause in the example above requires Item to conform to a protocol, but you can also write a generic where clauses that require Item to be a specific type. For example:

```swift
extension Container where Item == Double {
    func average() -> Double {
        var sum = 0.0
        for index in 0..<count {
            sum += self[index]
        }
        return sum / Double(count)
    }
}
print([1260.0, 1200.0, 98.6, 37.0].average())
// Prints "648.9"
```

You can include multiple requirements in a generic where clause that’s part of an extension, just like you can for a generic where clause that you write elsewhere. Separate each requirement in the list with a comma.

## Contextual Where Clauses

You can write a generic where clause as part of a declaration that doesn’t have its own generic type constraints, when you’re already working in the context of generic types. For example, you can write a generic where clause on a subscript of a generic type or on a method in an extension to a generic type. The Container structure is generic, and the where clauses in the example below specify what type constraints have to be satisfied to make these new methods available on a container.

```swift
extension Container {
    func average() -> Double where Item == Int {
        var sum = 0.0
        for index in 0..<count {
            sum += Double(self[index])
        }
        return sum / Double(count)
    }
    func endsWith(_ item: Item) -> Bool where Item: Equatable {
        return count >= 1 && self[count-1] == item
    }
}
let numbers = [1260, 1200, 98, 37]
print(numbers.average())
// Prints "648.75"
print(numbers.endsWith(37))
// Prints "true"
```

If you want to write this code without using contextual where clauses, you write two extensions, one for each generic where clause. The example above and the example below have the same behavior.

```swift
extension Container where Item == Int {
    func average() -> Double {
        var sum = 0.0
        for index in 0..<count {
            sum += Double(self[index])
        }
        return sum / Double(count)
    }
}
extension Container where Item: Equatable {
    func endsWith(_ item: Item) -> Bool {
        return count >= 1 && self[count-1] == item
    }
}
```

Moving those requirements to the extensions’ generic where clauses makes the methods available in the same situations, but requires one extension per requirement.

## Associated Types with a Generic Where Clause

You can include a generic where clause on an associated type. For example, suppose you want to make a version of Container that includes an iterator, like what the Sequence protocol uses in the standard library. Here’s how you write that:

```swift
protocol Container {
    associatedtype Item
    mutating func append(_ item: Item)
    var count: Int { get }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Item { get }

    associatedtype Iterator: IteratorProtocol where Iterator.Element == Item
    func makeIterator() -> Iterator
}
```

The generic where clause on Iterator requires that the iterator must traverse over elements of the same item type as the container’s items, regardless of the iterator’s type. The makeIterator() function provides access to a container’s iterator.
  
For a protocol that inherits from another protocol, you add a constraint to an inherited associated type by including the generic where clause in the protocol declaration. For example, the following code declares a ComparableContainer protocol that requires Item to conform to Comparable:

```swift
protocol ComparableContainer: Container where Item: Comparable { }
```

## Generic Subscripts

Subscripts can be generic, and they can include generic where clauses. You write the placeholder type name inside angle brackets after subscript, and you write a generic where clause right before the opening curly brace of the subscript’s body. For example:

```swift
extension Container {
    subscript<Indices: Sequence>(indices: Indices) -> [Item]
        where Indices.Iterator.Element == Int {
            var result: [Item] = []
            for index in indices {
                result.append(self[index])
            }
            return result
    }
}
```

This extension to the Container protocol adds a subscript that takes a sequence of indices and returns an array containing the items at each given index. This generic subscript is constrained as follows:

- The generic parameter Indices in angle brackets has to be a type that conforms to the Sequence protocol from the standard library.
- The subscript takes a single parameter, indices, which is an instance of that Indices type.
- The generic where clause requires that the iterator for the sequence must traverse over elements of type Int. This ensures that the indices in the sequence are the same type as the indices used for a container.

Taken together, these constraints mean that the value passed for the indices parameter is a sequence of integers.
