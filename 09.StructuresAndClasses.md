# Structures and Classes

Structures and classes are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your program’s code. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your structures and classes using the same syntax you use to define constants, variables, and functions.
  
In Swift, you define a structure or class in a single file, and the external interface to that class or structure is automatically made available for other code to use.

## Comparing Structures and Classes

Structures and classes in Swift have many things in common. Both can:

- Define **properties** to store values
- Define **methods** to provide functionality
- Define **subscripts** to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
- Define **initializers** to set up their initial state
- Be **extended** to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
- Conform to **protocols** to provide standard functionality of a certain kind

Classes have additional capabilities that structures don’t have:

- **Inheritance enables one class** to inherit the characteristics of another.
- Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
- **Deinitializers enable an instance of a class** to free up any resources it has assigned.
- Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

### Definition Syntax

Structures and classes have a similar definition syntax. You introduce structures with the struct keyword and classes with the class keyword. Both place their entire definition within a pair of braces:

```swift
struct SomeStructure {
    // structure definition goes here
}
class SomeClass {
    // class definition goes here
}
```

Here’s an example of a structure definition and a class definition:

```swift
struct Resolution {
    var width = 0
    var height = 0
}
class VideoMode {
    var resolution = Resolution()
    var interlaced = false
    var frameRate = 0.0
    var name: String?
}
```

### Structure and Class instances

The Resolution structure definition and the VideoMode class definition only describe what a Resolution or VideoMode will look like. They themselves don’t describe a specific resolution or video mode. To do that, you need to create an instance of the structure or class.
  
The syntax for creating instances is very similar for both structures and classes:

```swift
let someResolution = Resolution()
let someVideoMode = VideoMode()
```

### Accessing Properties

You can access the properties of an instance using dot syntax. In dot syntax, you write the property name immediately after the instance name, separated by a period (.), without any spaces:

```swift
print("The width of someResolution is \(someResolution.width)")
// Prints "The width of someResolution is 0"
```

You can drill down into subproperties, such as the width property in the resolution property of a VideoMode:

```swift
print("The width of someVideoMode is \(someVideoMode.resolution.width)")
// Prints "The width of someVideoMode is 0"
```

You can also use dot syntax to assign a new value to a variable property:

```swift
someVideoMode.resolution.width = 1280
print("The width of someVideoMode is now \(someVideoMode.resolution.width)")
// Prints "The width of someVideoMode is now 1280"
```

### Memberwise Initializers for Structure Types

All structures have an automatically generated memberwise initializer, which you can use to initialize the member properties of new structure instances. Initial values for the properties of the new instance can be passed to the memberwise initializer by name:

```swift
let vga = Resolution(width: 640, height: 480)
//width = 640  height = 480
```

## Structures and Enumerations Are Value Types

A value type is a type whose value is copied when it’s assigned to a variable or constant, or when it’s passed to a function.
  
You’ve actually been using value types extensively throughout the previous chapters. In fact, all of the basic types in Swift—**integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays and dictionaries**—are value types, and are implemented as structures behind the scenes.
  
All structures and enumerations are value types in Swift. This means that any structure and enumeration instances you create—and any value types they have as properties—are always copied when they’re passed around in your code.
  
Consider this example, which uses the Resolution structure from the previous example:

```swift
let hd = Resolution(width: 1920, height: 1080)
var cinema = hd
```

Even though hd and cinema now have the same width and height, they’re two completely different instances behind the scenes.
  
Next, the width property of cinema is amended to be the width of the slightly wider 2K standard used for digital cinema projection (2048 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high):

```swift
cinema.width = 2048
```

Checking the width property of cinema shows that it has indeed changed to be 2048:

```swift
print("cinema is now \(cinema.width) pixels wide")
// Prints "cinema is now 2048 pixels wide"
```

However, the width property of the original hd instance still has the old value of 1920:

```swift
print("hd is still \(hd.width) pixels wide")
// Prints "hd is still 1920 pixels wide"
```

They’re separate instances, setting the width of cinema to 2048 doesn’t affect the width stored in hd, as shown in the figure below:

![Value Types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/sharedStateStruct_2x.png)

The same behavior applies to enumerations:

```swift
enum CompassPoint {
    case north, south, east, west
    mutating func turnNorth() {
        self = .north
    }
}
var currentDirection = CompassPoint.west
let rememberedDirection = currentDirection
currentDirection.turnNorth()

print("The current direction is \(currentDirection)")
print("The remembered direction is \(rememberedDirection)")
// Prints "The current direction is north"
// Prints "The remembered direction is west"
```

## Classes Are Reference Types

Unlike value types, **reference types are not copied when they’re assigned to a variable or constant, or when they’re passed to a function.** Rather than a copy, **a reference to the same existing instance is used**.
    
Here’s an example, using the VideoMode class defined above:

```swift
let tenEighty = VideoMode()
tenEighty.resolution = hd
tenEighty.interlaced = true
tenEighty.name = "1080i"
tenEighty.frameRate = 25.0
```

Next, tenEighty is assigned to a new constant, called alsoTenEighty, and the frame rate of alsoTenEighty is modified:

```swift
let alsoTenEighty = tenEighty
alsoTenEighty.frameRate = 30.0
```

Because classes are reference types, tenEighty and alsoTenEighty actually both refer to the same VideoMode instance. Effectively, they’re just two different names for the same single instance, as shown in the figure below:

![Reference Types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/sharedStateClass_2x.png)

```swift
print("The frameRate property of tenEighty is now \(tenEighty.frameRate)")
// Prints "The frameRate property of tenEighty is now 30.0"
```

### Identity Operators

Because classes are reference types, it’s possible for multiple constants and variables to refer to the same single instance of a class behind the scenes. (The same isn’t true for structures and enumerations, because they’re always copied when they’re assigned to a constant or variable, or passed to a function.)
  
It can sometimes be useful to find out whether two constants or variables refer to exactly the same instance of a class. To enable this, Swift provides two identity operators:

- Identical to (===)
- Not identical to (!==)

Use these operators to check whether two constants or variables refer to the same single instance:

```swift
if tenEighty === alsoTenEighty {
    print("tenEighty and alsoTenEighty refer to the same VideoMode instance.")
}
// Prints "tenEighty and alsoTenEighty refer to the same VideoMode instance."
```

### Pointers

If you have experience with C, C++, or Objective-C, you may know that these languages use pointers to refer to addresses in memory.
  
A Swift constant or variable that refers to an instance of some reference type is similar to a pointer in C, **but isn’t a direct pointer to an address in memory, and doesn’t require you to write an asterisk (*) to indicate that you are creating a reference**.
  
Instead, these references are defined like any other constant or variable in Swift. The standard library provides pointer and buffer types that you can use if you need to interact with pointers directly
