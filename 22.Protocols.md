# Protocols

A protocol defines **a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality.** The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.
  
In addition to specifying requirements that conforming types must implement, you can extend a protocol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that conforming types can take advantage of.

## Protocol Syntax

You define protocols in a very similar way to classes, structures, and enumerations:

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    // protocol definition goes here
}
```

Custom types state that they adopt a particular protocol by placing the protocol’s name after the type’s name, separated by a colon, as part of their definition. Multiple protocols can be listed, and are separated by commas:

```swift
struct SomeStructure: FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // structure definition goes here
}
```
If a class has a superclass, list the superclass name before any protocols it adopts, followed by a comma:

```swift
class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // class definition goes here
}
```

## Property Requirements

**A protocol can require any conforming type to provide an instance property or type property with a particular name and type.** The protocol doesn’t specify whether the property should be a stored property or a computed property—it only specifies the required property name and type. The protocol also specifies whether each property must be gettable or gettable and settable.
  
If a protocol requires a property to be gettable and settable, that property requirement can’t be fulfilled by a constant stored property or a read-only computed property.   If the protocol only requires a property to be gettable, the requirement can be satisfied by any kind of property, and it’s valid for the property to be also settable if this is useful for your own code.
  
Property requirements are always declared as variable properties, prefixed with the var keyword. Gettable and settable properties are indicated by writing { get set } after their type declaration, and gettable properties are indicated by writing { get }.

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    var mustBeSettable: Int { get set }
    var doesNotNeedToBeSettable: Int { get }
}
```

Always prefix type property requirements with the static keyword when you define them in a protocol. This rule pertains even though type property requirements can be prefixed with the class or static keyword when implemented by a class:

```swift
protocol AnotherProtocol {
    static var someTypeProperty: Int { get set }
}
```

Here’s an example of a protocol with a single instance property requirement:

```swift
protocol FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String { get }
}
```

Here’s an example of a simple structure that adopts and conforms to the FullyNamed protocol:

```swift
struct Person: FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String
}
let john = Person(fullName: "John Appleseed")
// john.fullName is "John Appleseed"
```

Here’s a more complex class, which also adopts and conforms to the FullyNamed protocol:

```swift
class Starship: FullyNamed {
    var prefix: String?
    var name: String
    init(name: String, prefix: String? = nil) {
        self.name = name
        self.prefix = prefix
    }
    var fullName: String {
        return (prefix != nil ? prefix! + " " : "") + name
    }
}
var ncc1701 = Starship(name: "Enterprise", prefix: "USS")
// ncc1701.fullName is "USS Enterprise"
```

This class implements the fullName property requirement as a computed read-only property for a starship.

## Method Requirements

Protocols can require specific instance methods and type methods to be implemented by conforming types. These methods are written as part of the protocol’s definition in exactly the same way as for normal instance and type methods, but without curly braces or a method body. Variadic parameters are allowed, subject to the same rules as for normal methods. Default values, however, can’t be specified for method parameters within a protocol’s definition.
  
This is true even though type method requirements are prefixed with the class or static keyword when implemented by a class:

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    static func someTypeMethod()
}
```

The following example defines a protocol with a single instance method requirement:

```swift
protocol RandomNumberGenerator {
    func random() -> Double
}
```

Here’s an implementation of a class that adopts and conforms to the RandomNumberGenerator protocol. This class implements a pseudorandom number generator algorithm known as a linear congruential generator:

```swift
class LinearCongruentialGenerator: RandomNumberGenerator {
    var lastRandom = 42.0
    let m = 139968.0
    let a = 3877.0
    let c = 29573.0
    func random() -> Double {
        lastRandom = ((lastRandom * a + c)
            .truncatingRemainder(dividingBy:m))
        return lastRandom / m
    }
}
let generator = LinearCongruentialGenerator()
print("Here's a random number: \(generator.random())")
// Prints "Here's a random number: 0.3746499199817101"
print("And another one: \(generator.random())")
// Prints "And another one: 0.729023776863283"
```

## Mutating Method Requirements

It’s sometimes necessary for a method to modify (or mutate) the instance it belongs to. For instance methods on value types (that is, structures and enumerations) you place the mutating keyword before a method’s func keyword to indicate that the method is allowed to modify the instance it belongs to and any properties of that instance. 
  
If you define a protocol instance method requirement that’s intended to mutate instances of any type that adopts the protocol, mark the method with the mutating keyword as part of the protocol’s definition. This enables structures and enumerations to adopt the protocol and satisfy that method requirement.
  
> If you mark a protocol instance method requirement as mutating, you don’t need to write the mutating keyword when writing an implementation of that method for a class. **The mutating keyword is only used by structures and enumerations.**
  
The example below defines a protocol called Togglable, which defines a single instance method requirement called toggle. As its name suggests, the toggle() method is intended to toggle or invert the state of any conforming type, typically by modifying a property of that type.

```swift
protocol Togglable {
    mutating func toggle()
}
```

If you implement the Togglable protocol for a **structure or enumeration**, that structure or enumeration can conform to the protocol by providing an implementation of t**he toggle() method that’s also marked as mutating.**
  
The example below defines an enumeration called OnOffSwitch. This enumeration toggles between two states, indicated by the enumeration cases on and off. The enumeration’s toggle implementation is marked as mutating, to match the Togglable protocol’s requirements:

```swift
enum OnOffSwitch: Togglable {
    case off, on
    mutating func toggle() {
        switch self {
        case .off:
            self = .on
        case .on:
            self = .off
        }
    }
}
var lightSwitch = OnOffSwitch.off
lightSwitch.toggle()
// lightSwitch is now equal to .on
```

## Initalizer Requirements

Protocols can require specific initializers to be implemented by conforming types. You write these initializers as part of the protocol’s definition in exactly the same way as for normal initializers, but without curly braces or an initializer body:

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    init(someParameter: Int)
}
```

### Class Implementations of Protocol Initializer Requirements

You can implement a protocol initializer requirement on a conforming class as either a designated initializer or a convenience initializer. In both cases, you must mark the initializer implementation **with the required modifier**:

```swift
class SomeClass: SomeProtocol {
    required init(someParameter: Int) {
        // initializer implementation goes here
    }
}
```

The use of the required modifier ensures that you provide an explicit or inherited implementation of the initializer requirement on all subclasses of the conforming class, such that they also conform to the protocol.

> You don’t need to mark protocol initializer implementations with the required modifier on classes that are marked with the final modifier, because final classes can’t subclassed. For more about the final modifier

If a subclass overrides a designated initializer from a superclass, and also implements a matching initializer requirement from a protocol, mark the initializer implementation with both the required and override modifiers:

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    init()
}

class SomeSuperClass {
    init() {
        // initializer implementation goes here
    }
}

class SomeSubClass: SomeSuperClass, SomeProtocol {
    // "required" from SomeProtocol conformance; "override" from SomeSuperClass
    required override init() {
        // initializer implementation goes here
    }
}
```

### Failable Initializer Requirements

A failable initializer requirement can be satisfied by a failable or nonfailable initializer on a conforming type. A nonfailable initializer requirement can be satisfied by a nonfailable initializer or an implicitly unwrapped failable initializer.

## Protocols as Types

Protocols don’t actually implement any functionality themselves. Nonetheless, you can use protocols as a fully fledged types in your code. Using a protocol as a type is sometimes called an existential type, which comes from the phrase “there exists a type T such that T conforms to the protocol”.
  
You can use a protocol in many places where other types are allowed, including:

- As a parameter type or return type in a function, method, or initializer
- As the type of a constant, variable, or property
- As the type of items in an array, dictionary, or other container

Here’s an example of a protocol used as a type:

```swift
protocol RandomNumberGenerator {
    func random() -> Double
}

class Dice {
    let sides: Int
    let generator: RandomNumberGenerator
    init(sides: Int, generator: RandomNumberGenerator) {
        self.sides = sides
        self.generator = generator
    }
    func roll() -> Int {
        return Int(generator.random() * Double(sides)) + 1
    }
}
```

The generator property is of type RandomNumberGenerator. Therefore, you can set it to an instance of any type that adopts the RandomNumberGenerator protocol.
  
Here’s how the Dice class can be used to create a six-sided dice with a LinearCongruentialGenerator instance as its random number generator:

```swift
var d6 = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
for _ in 1...5 {
    print("Random dice roll is \(d6.roll())")
}
// Random dice roll is 3
// Random dice roll is 5
// Random dice roll is 4
// Random dice roll is 5
// Random dice roll is 4
```

## Delegation

**Delegation is a design pattern that enables a class or structure to hand off (or delegate) some of its responsibilities to an instance of another type.** This design pattern is implemented by defining a protocol that encapsulates the delegated responsibilities, such that a conforming type (known as a delegate) is guaranteed to provide the functionality that has been delegated. **Delegation can be used to respond to a particular action, or to retrieve data from an external source without needing to know the underlying type of that source.**
  
The example below defines two protocols for use with dice-based board games:

```swift
protocol DiceGame {
    var dice: Dice { get }
    func play()
}
protocol DiceGameDelegate: AnyObject {
    func gameDidStart(_ game: DiceGame)
    func game(_ game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int)
    func gameDidEnd(_ game: DiceGame)
}
```

- The DiceGame protocol is a protocol that can be adopted by any game that involves dice.
- The DiceGameDelegate protocol can be adopted to track the progress of a DiceGame.

This version is adapted to use a Dice instance for its dice-rolls; to adopt the DiceGame protocol; and to notify a DiceGameDelegate about its progress:

```swift
class SnakesAndLadders: DiceGame {
    let finalSquare = 25
    let dice = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
    var square = 0
    var board: [Int]
    init() {
        board = Array(repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
        board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
        board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
    }
    weak var delegate: DiceGameDelegate?
    func play() {
        square = 0
        delegate?.gameDidStart(self)
        gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
            let diceRoll = dice.roll()
            delegate?.game(self, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll: diceRoll)
            switch square + diceRoll {
            case finalSquare:
                break gameLoop
            case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
                continue gameLoop
            default:
                square += diceRoll
                square += board[square]
            }
        }
        delegate?.gameDidEnd(self)
    }
}
```

The Snakes and Ladders game board setup takes place within the class’s init() initializer. All game logic is moved into the protocol’s play method, which uses the protocol’s required dice property to provide its dice roll values.
  
Note that the delegate property is defined as an optional DiceGameDelegate, because a delegate isn’t required in order to play the game. Because it’s of an optional type, the delegate property is automatically set to an initial value of nil.
  
Because the delegate property is an optional DiceGameDelegate, the play() method uses optional chaining each time it calls a method on the delegate. If the delegate property is nil, these delegate calls fail gracefully and without error. If the delegate property is non-nil, the delegate methods are called, and are passed the SnakesAndLadders instance as a parameter.
  
This next example shows a class called DiceGameTracker, which adopts the DiceGameDelegate protocol:

```swift
class DiceGameTracker: DiceGameDelegate {
    var numberOfTurns = 0
    func gameDidStart(_ game: DiceGame) {
        numberOfTurns = 0
        if game is SnakesAndLadders {
            print("Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders")
        }
        print("The game is using a \(game.dice.sides)-sided dice")
    }
    func game(_ game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int) {
        numberOfTurns += 1
        print("Rolled a \(diceRoll)")
    }
    func gameDidEnd(_ game: DiceGame) {
        print("The game lasted for \(numberOfTurns) turns")
    }
}
```

DiceGameTracker implements all three methods required by DiceGameDelegate. It uses these methods to keep track of the number of turns a game has taken. It resets a numberOfTurns property to zero when the game starts, increments it each time a new turn begins, and prints out the total number of turns once the game has ended.
  
Here’s how DiceGameTracker looks in action:

```swift
let tracker = DiceGameTracker()
let game = SnakesAndLadders()
game.delegate = tracker
game.play()
// Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders
// The game is using a 6-sided dice
// Rolled a 3
// Rolled a 5
// Rolled a 4
// Rolled a 5
// The game lasted for 4 turns
```

## Adding Protocol Conformance with an Extension

You can extend an existing type to adopt and conform to a new protocol, even if you don’t have access to the source code for the existing type. Extensions can add new properties, methods, and subscripts to an existing type, and are therefore able to add any requirements that a protocol may demand.
  
For example, this protocol, called TextRepresentable, can be implemented by any type that has a way to be represented as text. This might be a description of itself, or a text version of its current state:

```swift
protocol TextRepresentable {
    var textualDescription: String { get }
}
```

The Dice class from above can be extended to adopt and conform to TextRepresentable:

```swift
extension Dice: TextRepresentable {
    var textualDescription: String {
        return "A \(sides)-sided dice"
    }
}
```

Any Dice instance can now be treated as TextRepresentable:

```swift
let d12 = Dice(sides: 12, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
print(d12.textualDescription)
// Prints "A 12-sided dice"
```

Similarly, the SnakesAndLadders game class can be extended to adopt and conform to the TextRepresentable protocol:

```swift
extension SnakesAndLadders: TextRepresentable {
    var textualDescription: String {
        return "A game of Snakes and Ladders with \(finalSquare) squares"
    }
}
print(game.textualDescription)
// Prints "A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares"
```

### Conditionally Conforming to a Protocol

A generic type may be able to satisfy the requirements of a protocol only under certain conditions, such as when the type’s generic parameter conforms to the protocol. You can make a generic type conditionally conform to a protocol by listing constraints when extending the type. Write these constraints after the name of the protocol you’re adopting by writing a generic where clause.
  
The following extension makes Array instances conform to the TextRepresentable protocol whenever they store elements of a type that conforms to TextRepresentable.

```swift
extension Array: TextRepresentable where Element: TextRepresentable {
    var textualDescription: String {
        let itemsAsText = self.map { $0.textualDescription }
        return "[" + itemsAsText.joined(separator: ", ") + "]"
    }
}
let myDice = [d6, d12]
print(myDice.textualDescription)
// Prints "[A 6-sided dice, A 12-sided dice]"
```

### Declaring Protocol Adoption with an Extension

If a type already conforms to all of the requirements of a protocol, but hasn’t yet stated that it adopts that protocol, you can make it adopt the protocol with an empty extension:

```swift
struct Hamster {
    var name: String
    var textualDescription: String {
        return "A hamster named \(name)"
    }
}
extension Hamster: TextRepresentable {}
Instances of Hamster can now be used wherever TextRepresentable is the required type:

let simonTheHamster = Hamster(name: "Simon")
let somethingTextRepresentable: TextRepresentable = simonTheHamster
print(somethingTextRepresentable.textualDescription)
// Prints "A hamster named Simon"
```

## Adopting a Protocol Using a Synthesized Implementation

Swift can automatically provide the protocol conformance for **Equatable, Hashable, and Comparable** in many simple cases. Using this synthesized implementation means you don’t have to write repetitive boilerplate code to implement the protocol requirements yourself.

Swift provides a synthesized implementation of Equatable for the following kinds of custom types:

- Structures that have only stored properties that conform to the Equatable protocol
- Enumerations that have only associated types that conform to the Equatable protocol
- Enumerations that have no associated types

To receive a synthesized implementation of ==, declare conformance to Equatable in the file that contains the original declaration, without implementing an == operator yourself. The Equatable protocol provides a default implementation of !=.
  
The example below defines a Vector3D structure for a three-dimensional position vector (x, y, z), similar to the Vector2D structure. Because the x, y, and z properties are all of an Equatable type, Vector3D receives synthesized implementations of the equivalence operators.

```swift
struct Vector3D: Equatable {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
}

let twoThreeFour = Vector3D(x: 2.0, y: 3.0, z: 4.0)
let anotherTwoThreeFour = Vector3D(x: 2.0, y: 3.0, z: 4.0)
if twoThreeFour == anotherTwoThreeFour {
    print("These two vectors are also equivalent.")
}
// Prints "These two vectors are also equivalent."
```

Swift provides a synthesized implementation of Hashable for the following kinds of custom types:

- Structures that have only stored properties that conform to the Hashable protocol
- Enumerations that have only associated types that conform to the Hashable protocol
- Enumerations that have no associated types

Swift provides a synthesized implementation of Comparable for enumerations that don’t have a raw value. If the enumeration has associated types, they must all conform to the Comparable protocol. To receive a synthesized implementation of <, declare conformance to Comparable in the file that contains the original enumeration declaration, without implementing a < operator yourself. The Comparable protocol’s default implementation of <=, >, and >= provides the remaining comparison operators.

The example below defines a SkillLevel enumeration with cases for beginners, intermediates, and experts. Experts are additionally ranked by the number of stars they have.

```swift
enum SkillLevel: Comparable {
    case beginner
    case intermediate
    case expert(stars: Int)
}
var levels = [SkillLevel.intermediate, SkillLevel.beginner,
              SkillLevel.expert(stars: 5), SkillLevel.expert(stars: 3)]
for level in levels.sorted() {
    print(level)
}
// Prints "beginner"
// Prints "intermediate"
// Prints "expert(stars: 3)"
// Prints "expert(stars: 5)"
```

## Collections of Protocol Types

A protocol can be used as the type to be stored in a collection such as an array or a dictionary, as mentioned in Protocols as Types. This example creates an array of TextRepresentable things:
  
It’s now possible to iterate over the items in the array, and print each item’s textual description:

```swift
let things: [TextRepresentable] = [game, d12, simonTheHamster]

for thing in things {
    print(thing.textualDescription)
}
// A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares
// A 12-sided dice
// A hamster named Simon
```

## Protocol Inheritance

**A protocol can inherit one or more other protocols and can add further requirements on top of the requirements it inherits.** The syntax for protocol inheritance is similar to the syntax for class inheritance, but with the option to list multiple inherited protocols, separated by commas:

```swift
protocol InheritingProtocol: SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // protocol definition goes here
}
```

Here’s an example of a protocol that inherits the TextRepresentable protocol from above:

```swift
protocol PrettyTextRepresentable: TextRepresentable {
    var prettyTextualDescription: String { get }
}
```

The SnakesAndLadders class can be extended to adopt and conform to PrettyTextRepresentable:

```swift
extension SnakesAndLadders: PrettyTextRepresentable {
    var prettyTextualDescription: String {
        var output = textualDescription + ":\n"
        for index in 1...finalSquare {
            switch board[index] {
            case let ladder where ladder > 0:
                output += "▲ "
            case let snake where snake < 0:
                output += "▼ "
            default:
                output += "○ "
            }
        }
        return output
    }
}
```

The prettyTextualDescription property can now be used to print a pretty text description of any SnakesAndLadders instance:

```swift
print(game.prettyTextualDescription)
// A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares:
// ○ ○ ▲ ○ ○ ▲ ○ ○ ▲ ▲ ○ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ○ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ▼ ○
```

## Class-Only Protocols

You can limit protocol adoption to class types (and not structures or enumerations) by **adding the AnyObject protocol to a protocol’s inheritance list.**

```swift
protocol SomeClassOnlyProtocol: AnyObject, SomeInheritedProtocol {
    // class-only protocol definition goes here
}
```

In the example above, SomeClassOnlyProtocol can only be adopted by class types. It’s a compile-time error to write a structure or enumeration definition that tries to adopt SomeClassOnlyProtocol.

> Use a class-only protocol when the behavior defined by that protocol’s requirements assumes or requires that a conforming type has reference semantics rather than value semantics.

## Protocol Composition

It can be useful to require a type to conform to multiple protocols at the same time. You can combine multiple protocols into a single requirement with a protocol composition.  Protocol compositions behave as if you defined a temporary local protocol that has the combined requirements of all protocols in the composition. Protocol compositions don’t define any new protocol types.
  
You can list as many protocols as you need, separating them with ampersands (&). In addition to its list of protocols, a protocol composition can also contain one class type, which you can use to specify a required superclass.
  
Here’s an example that combines two protocols called Named and Aged into a single protocol composition requirement on a function parameter:

```swift
protocol Named {
    var name: String { get }
}
protocol Aged {
    var age: Int { get }
}
struct Person: Named, Aged {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}
func wishHappyBirthday(to celebrator: Named & Aged) {
    print("Happy birthday, \(celebrator.name), you're \(celebrator.age)!")
}
let birthdayPerson = Person(name: "Malcolm", age: 21)
wishHappyBirthday(to: birthdayPerson)
// Prints "Happy birthday, Malcolm, you're 21!"
```

Here’s an example that combines the Named protocol from the previous example with a Location class:

```swift
class Location {
    var latitude: Double
    var longitude: Double
    init(latitude: Double, longitude: Double) {
        self.latitude = latitude
        self.longitude = longitude
    }
}
class City: Location, Named {
    var name: String
    init(name: String, latitude: Double, longitude: Double) {
        self.name = name
        super.init(latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude)
    }
}
func beginConcert(in location: Location & Named) {
    print("Hello, \(location.name)!")
}

let seattle = City(name: "Seattle", latitude: 47.6, longitude: -122.3)
beginConcert(in: seattle)
// Prints "Hello, Seattle!"
```

## Checking for Protocol Conformance

You can use the is and as operators described in Type Casting to check for protocol conformance, and to cast to a specific protocol. Checking for and casting to a protocol follows exactly the same syntax as checking for and casting to a type:

- The is operator returns true if an instance conforms to a protocol and returns false if it doesn’t.
- The as? version of the downcast operator returns an optional value of the protocol’s type, and this value is nil if the instance doesn’t conform to that protocol.
- The as! version of the downcast operator forces the downcast to the protocol type and triggers a runtime error if the downcast doesn’t succeed.

This example defines a protocol called HasArea, with a single property requirement of a gettable Double property called area:

```swift
protocol HasArea {
    var area: Double { get }
}
Here are two classes, Circle and Country, both of which conform to the HasArea protocol:

class Circle: HasArea {
    let pi = 3.1415927
    var radius: Double
    var area: Double { return pi * radius * radius }
    init(radius: Double) { self.radius = radius }
}
class Country: HasArea {
    var area: Double
    init(area: Double) { self.area = area }
}
```

Here’s a class called Animal, which doesn’t conform to the HasArea protocol:

```swift
class Animal {
    var legs: Int
    init(legs: Int) { self.legs = legs }
}
```

The Circle, Country and Animal classes don’t have a shared base class. Nonetheless, they’re all classes, and so instances of all three types can be used to initialize an array that stores values of type AnyObject:

```swift
let objects: [AnyObject] = [
    Circle(radius: 2.0),
    Country(area: 243_610),
    Animal(legs: 4)
]
```

The objects array can now be iterated, and each object in the array can be checked to see if it conforms to the HasArea protocol:

```swift
for object in objects {
    if let objectWithArea = object as? HasArea {
        print("Area is \(objectWithArea.area)")
    } else {
        print("Something that doesn't have an area")
    }
}
// Area is 12.5663708
// Area is 243610.0
// Something that doesn't have an area

## Optional Protocol Requirements

You can define optional requirements for protocols. These requirements don’t have to be implemented by types that conform to the protocol. Optional requirements are prefixed by the optional modifier as part of the protocol’s definition. Optional requirements are available so that you can write code that interoperates with Objective-C. Both the protocol and the optional requirement must be marked with the @objc attribute. Note that @objc protocols can be adopted only by classes that inherit from Objective-C classes or other @objc classes. They can’t be adopted by structures or enumerations.

When you use a method or property in an optional requirement, its type automatically becomes an optional. For example:

- a method of type (Int) -> String 
- becomes ((Int) -> String)?.

Note that the entire function type is wrapped in the optional, not the method’s return value.
  
The following example defines an integer-counting class called Counter, which uses an external data source to provide its increment amount. This data source is defined by the CounterDataSource protocol, which has two optional requirements:

```swift
@objc protocol CounterDataSource {
    @objc optional func increment(forCount count: Int) -> Int
    @objc optional var fixedIncrement: Int { get }
}
```

The Counter class, defined below, has an optional dataSource property of type CounterDataSource?:

```swift
class Counter {
    var count = 0
    var dataSource: CounterDataSource?
    func increment() {
        if let amount = dataSource?.increment?(forCount: count) {
            count += amount
        } else if let amount = dataSource?.fixedIncrement {
            count += amount
        }
    }
}
```

Here’s a simple CounterDataSource implementation where the data source returns a constant value of 3 every time it’s queried. It does this by implementing the optional fixedIncrement property requirement:

```swift
class ThreeSource: NSObject, CounterDataSource {
    let fixedIncrement = 3
}
```

You can use an instance of ThreeSource as the data source for a new Counter instance:

```swift
var counter = Counter()
counter.dataSource = ThreeSource()
for _ in 1...4 {
    counter.increment()
    print(counter.count)
}
// 3
// 6
// 9
// 12
```

Here’s a more complex data source called TowardsZeroSource, which makes a Counter instance count up or down towards zero from its current count value:

```swift
class TowardsZeroSource: NSObject, CounterDataSource {
    func increment(forCount count: Int) -> Int {
        if count == 0 {
            return 0
        } else if count < 0 {
            return 1
        } else {
            return -1
        }
    }
}
```

You can use an instance of TowardsZeroSource with the existing Counter instance to count from -4 to zero. Once the counter reaches zero, no more counting takes place:

```swift
counter.count = -4
counter.dataSource = TowardsZeroSource()
for _ in 1...5 {
    counter.increment()
    print(counter.count)
}
// -3
// -2
// -1
// 0
// 0
```

## Protocol Extensions

**Protocols can be extended to provide method, initializer, subscript, and computed property implementations to conforming types.** This allows you to define behavior on protocols themselves, rather than in each type’s individual conformance or in a global function.
  
For example, the RandomNumberGenerator protocol can be extended to provide a randomBool() method, which uses the result of the required random() method to return a random Bool value:

```swift
extension RandomNumberGenerator {
    func randomBool() -> Bool {
        return random() > 0.5
    }
}
```

By creating an extension on the protocol, all conforming types automatically gain this method implementation without any additional modification.

```swift
let generator = LinearCongruentialGenerator()
print("Here's a random number: \(generator.random())")
// Prints "Here's a random number: 0.3746499199817101"
print("And here's a random Boolean: \(generator.randomBool())")
// Prints "And here's a random Boolean: true"
```

Protocol extensions can add implementations to conforming types but can’t make a protocol extend or inherit from another protocol. Protocol inheritance is always specified in the protocol declaration itself.

### Providing Default Implementations

You can use protocol extensions to provide a default implementation to any method or computed property requirement of that protocol. If a conforming type provides its own implementation of a required method or property, that implementation will be used instead of the one provided by the extension.
  
For example, the PrettyTextRepresentable protocol, which inherits the TextRepresentable protocol can provide a default implementation of its required prettyTextualDescription property to simply return the result of accessing the textualDescription property:

```swift
extension PrettyTextRepresentable  {
    var prettyTextualDescription: String {
        return textualDescription
    }
}
```

### Adding Constraints to Protocol Extensions

When you define a protocol extension, you can specify constraints that conforming types must satisfy before the methods and properties of the extension are available. You write these constraints after the name of the protocol you’re extending by writing a generic where clause.
  
For example, you can define an extension to the Collection protocol that applies to any collection whose elements conform to the Equatable protocol. By constraining a collection’s elements to the Equatable protocol, a part of the standard library, you can use the == and != operators to check for equality and inequality between two elements.

```swift
extension Collection where Element: Equatable {
    func allEqual() -> Bool {
        for element in self {
            if element != self.first {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
}
```

Consider two arrays of integers, one where all the elements are the same, and one where they aren’t:

```swift
let equalNumbers = [100, 100, 100, 100, 100]
let differentNumbers = [100, 100, 200, 100, 200]
Because arrays conform to Collection and integers conform to Equatable, equalNumbers and differentNumbers can use the allEqual() method:

print(equalNumbers.allEqual())
// Prints "true"
print(differentNumbers.allEqual())
// Prints "false"
```
