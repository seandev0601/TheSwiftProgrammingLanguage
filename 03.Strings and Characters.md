# Strings and Characters

A string is a series of characters, such as "hello, world" or "albatross". Swift strings are represented by the String type. The contents of a String can be accessed in various ways, including as a collection of Character values.
  
Swift‚Äôs String and Character types provide a fast, Unicode-compliant way to work with text in your code. The syntax for string creation and manipulation is lightweight and readable, with a string literal syntax that‚Äôs similar to C. String concatenation is as simple as combining two strings with the + operator, and string mutability is managed by choosing between a constant or a variable, just like any other value in Swift. You can also use strings to insert constants, variables, literals, and expressions into longer strings, in a process known as string interpolation. This makes it easy to create custom string values for display, storage, and printing.

## String Literals

A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks (").

Use a string literal as an initial value for a constant or variable:

```swift
let someString = "Some string literal value"
let exampleString = "Example string literal value"
```

### Multiline String Literals

If you need a string that spans several lines, use a multiline string literal‚Äîa sequence of characters surrounded by three double quotation marks:

```swift
let quotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

A multiline string literal includes all of the lines between its opening and closing quotation marks. 

```swift
let singleLineString = "These are the same."
let multilineString = """
These are the same.
"""
```

When your source code includes a line break inside of a multiline string literal, that line break also appears in the string‚Äôs value. If you want to use line breaks to make your source code easier to read, but you **don‚Äôt want the line breaks** to be part of the string‚Äôs value, **write a backslash (\) at the end of those lines**:

```swift
let softWrappedQuotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, \
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on \
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

To make a multiline string literal that begins or ends with a line feed, write a blank line as the first or last line. For example:

```swift
let lineBreaks = """

This string starts with a line break.
It also ends with a line break.

"""
```

> A multiline string can be indented to match the surrounding code. The whitespace before the closing quotation marks (""") tells Swift what whitespace to ignore before all of the other lines.   
> However, if you write whitespace at the beginning of a line in addition to what‚Äôs before the closing quotation marks, that whitespace is included.

### Special Characters in String Literals

tring literals can include the following special characters:

- The escaped special characters \0 (null character), \\ (backslash), \t (horizontal tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quotation mark) and \' (single quotation mark)
- An arbitrary Unicode scalar value, written as \u{n}, where n is a 1‚Äì8 digit hexadecimal number (Unicode is discussed in Unicode below)

```swift
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
// "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
let dollarSign = "\u{24}"        // $,  Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"      // ‚ô•,  Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}" // üíñ, Unicode scalar U+1F496
```

Because multiline string literals use three double quotation marks instead of just one, you can include a double quotation mark (") inside of a multiline string literal without escaping it. To include the text """ in a multiline string, escape at least one of the quotation marks. For example:

```swift
let threeDoubleQuotationMarks = """
Escaping the first quotation mark \"""
Escaping all three quotation marks \"\"\"
"""
```

### Extended String Delimiters

You can place a string literal within extended delimiters to include special characters in a string without invoking their effect. You place your string within quotation marks (") and surround that with number signs (#). For example, printing the string literal `#"Line 1\nLine 2"#` prints the line feed escape sequence (\n) rather than printing the string across two lines.
  
If you need the special effects of a character in a string literal, match the number of number signs within the string following the escape character (\). For example, if your string is `#"Line 1\nLine 2"#` and you want to break the line, you can use `#"Line 1\#nLine 2"#` instead. Similarly, `###"Line1\###nLine2"###` also breaks the line.
  
String literals created using extended delimiters can also be multiline string literals. You can use extended delimiters to include the text """ in a multiline string, overriding the default behavior that ends the literal. For example:

```swift
let threeMoreDoubleQuotationMarks = #"""
Here are three more double quotes: """
"""#
```

## Initializing an Empty String

To create an empty String value as the starting point for building a longer string, either assign an empty string literal to a variable, or initialize a new String instance with initializer syntax:

```swift
var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initializer syntax
// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other
```
Find out whether a String value is empty by checking its Boolean isEmpty property:

```swift
if emptyString.isEmpty {
    print("Nothing to see here")
}
// Prints "Nothing to see here"
```

## String Mutability

You indicate whether a particular String can be modified (or mutated) by assigning it to a variable (in which case it can be modified), or to a constant (in which case it can‚Äôt be modified):

```swift
var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified
```

## Strings Are Value Types

**Swift‚Äôs String type is a value type.** If you create a new String value, that String value is copied when it‚Äôs passed to a function or method, or when it‚Äôs assigned to a constant or variable. In each case, a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned, not the original version.
  
Swift‚Äôs copy-by-default String behavior ensures that when a function or method passes you a String value, it‚Äôs clear that you own that exact String value, regardless of where it came from.

## Working with Characters

You can access the individual Character values for a String by iterating over the string with a for-in loop:

```swift
for character in "Dog!üê∂" {
    print(character)
}
// D
// o
// g
// !
// üê∂
```

Alternatively, you can create a stand-alone Character constant or variable from a single-character string literal by providing a Character type annotation:

`let exclamationMark: Character = "!"`
String values can be constructed by passing an array of Character values as an argument to its initializer:

```swift
let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]
let catString = String(catCharacters)
print(catString)
// Prints "Cat!üê±"
```

## Concatenating Strings and Characters

String values can be added together (or concatenated) with the addition operator (+) to create a new String value:

let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
var welcome = string1 + string2
// welcome now equals "hello there"
You can also append a String value to an existing String variable with the addition assignment operator (+=):

```swift
var instruction = "look over"
instruction += string2
// instruction now equals "look over there"
```

You can append a Character value to a String variable with the String type‚Äôs append() method:

```swift
let exclamationMark: Character = "!"
welcome.append(exclamationMark)
// welcome now equals "hello there!"
```

If you‚Äôre using multiline string literals to build up the lines of a longer string, you want every line in the string to end with a line break, including the last line. For example:

```swift
let badStart = """
one
two
"""
let end = """
three
"""
print(badStart + end)
// Prints two lines:
// one
// twothree

let goodStart = """
one
two

"""
print(goodStart + end)
// Prints three lines:
// one
// two
// three
```

## String Interpolation

String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from **a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions** by including their values inside a string literal. You can use string interpolation in both single-line and multiline string literals.

```swift
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
// message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"
```

Use extended string delimiters to create strings containing characters that would otherwise be treated as a string interpolation. For example:

```swift
print(#"Write an interpolated string in Swift using \(multiplier)."#)
// Prints "Write an interpolated string in Swift using \(multiplier)."
```

To use string interpolation inside a string that uses extended delimiters, match the number of number signs after the backslash to the number of number signs at the beginning and end of the string. For example:

```swift
print(#"6 times 7 is \#(6 * 7)."#)
// Prints "6 times 7 is 42."
```

## Unicode

Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems. It enables you to represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page. Swift‚Äôs String and Character types are fully Unicode-compliant, as described in this section.

### Unicode Scalar Values

Swift‚Äôs native String type is built from Unicode scalar values. A Unicode scalar value is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as U+0061 for LATIN SMALL LETTER A ("a"), or U+1F425 for FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK ("üê•").
  
Note that not all 21-bit Unicode scalar values are assigned to a character‚Äîsome scalars are reserved for future assignment or for use in UTF-16 encoding. Scalar values that have been assigned to a character typically also have a name, such as LATIN SMALL LETTER A and FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK in the examples above.

### Extended Grapheme Clusters

Every instance of Swift‚Äôs Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.
  
Here‚Äôs an example. The letter √© can be represented as the single Unicode scalar √© (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, or U+00E9). However, the same letter can also be represented as a pair of scalars‚Äîa standard letter e (LATIN SMALL LETTER E, or U+0065), followed by the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar (U+0301). The COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar is graphically applied to the scalar that precedes it, turning an e into an √© when it‚Äôs rendered by a Unicode-aware text-rendering system.
  
In both cases, the letter √© is represented as a single Swift Character value that represents an extended grapheme cluster. In the first case, the cluster contains a single scalar; in the second case, it‚Äôs a cluster of two scalars:

```swift
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                         // √©
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"          // e followed by ÃÅ
// eAcute is √©, combinedEAcute is eÃÅ
```

## Counting Characters

To retrieve a count of the Character values in a string, use the count property of the string:

```swift
let unusualMenagerie = "Koala üê®, Snail üêå, Penguin üêß, Dromedary üê™"
print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.count) characters")
// Prints "unusualMenagerie has 40 characters"
```

if you initialize a new string with the four-character word cafe, and then append a COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301) to the end of the string, the resulting string will still have a character count of 4, with a fourth character of eÃÅ, not e:

```swift
var word = "cafe"
print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafe is 4"

word += "\u{301}"    // COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, U+0301

print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafeÃÅ is 4"
```

## Accessing and Modifying a String

You access and modify a string through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.

### String Indices

Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each Character in the string.
  
Use the **startIndex** property to access the position of **the first Character** of a String. The **endIndex** property is the position after **the last character** in a String. As a result, the endIndex property isn‚Äôt a valid argument to a string‚Äôs subscript. **If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal**.
  
You access the indices before and after a given index using the `index(before:)` and `index(after:)` methods of String. To access an index farther away from the given index, you can use the `index(_:offsetBy:)` method instead of calling one of these methods multiple times.
  
You can use subscript syntax to access the Character at a particular String index.

```swift
let greeting = "Guten Tag!"
greeting[greeting.startIndex]
// G
greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)]
// !
greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)]
// u
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
greeting[index]
// a
```

Attempting to access an index outside of a string‚Äôs range or a Character at an index outside of a string‚Äôs range will trigger a runtime error.

```swift
greeting[greeting.endIndex] // Error
greeting.index(after: greeting.endIndex) // Error
```

Use the indices property to access all of the indices of individual characters in a string.

```swift
for index in greeting.indices {
    print("\(greeting[index]) ", terminator: "")
}
// Prints "G u t e n   T a g ! "
```

### Inserting and Removing

To insert a single character into a string at a specified index, use the `insert(_:at:)` method, and to insert the contents of another string at a specified index, use the `insert(contentsOf:at:)` method.

```swift
var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)
// welcome now equals "hello!"

welcome.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there!"
```

To remove a single character from a string at a specified index, use the `remove(at:)` method, and to remove a substring at a specified range, use the `removeSubrange(_:)` method:


```swift
welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there"

let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -6)..<welcome.endIndex
welcome.removeSubrange(range)
// welcome now equals "hello"
```

## Substrings

When you get a substring from a string‚Äîfor example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_:)‚Äîthe result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings.

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
let index = greeting.firstIndex(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
let beginning = greeting[..<index]
// beginning is "Hello"

// Convert the result to a String for long-term storage.
let newString = String(beginning)
```

## Comparing Strings

Swift provides three ways to compare textual values: **string** and **character equality**,** prefix equality,** and **suffix equality**.

### String and Character Equality

String and character equality is checked with the ‚Äúequal to‚Äù operator (==) and the ‚Äúnot equal to‚Äù operator (!=), as described in Comparison Operators:

```swift
let quotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
let sameQuotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
if quotation == sameQuotation {
    print("These two strings are considered equal")
}
// Prints "These two strings are considered equal"
```

Extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent if they have **the same linguistic meaning and appearance**, even if they‚Äôre composed from different Unicode scalars behind the scenes.
  
For example, LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+00E9) is canonically equivalent to LATIN SMALL LETTER E (U+0065) followed by COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301). Both of these extended grapheme clusters are valid ways to represent the character √©, and so they‚Äôre considered to be canonically equivalent:

```swift
// "Voulez-vous un caf√©?" using LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
let eAcuteQuestion = "Voulez-vous un caf\u{E9}?"

// "Voulez-vous un cafeÃÅ?" using LATIN SMALL LETTER E and COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
let combinedEAcuteQuestion = "Voulez-vous un caf\u{65}\u{301}?"

if eAcuteQuestion == combinedEAcuteQuestion {
    print("These two strings are considered equal")
}
// Prints "These two strings are considered equal"
```

Conversely, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041, or "A"), as used in English, is not equivalent to CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0410, or "–ê"), as used in Russian. The characters are visually similar, but don‚Äôt have the same linguistic meaning:

```swift
let latinCapitalLetterA: Character = "\u{41}"

let cyrillicCapitalLetterA: Character = "\u{0410}"

if latinCapitalLetterA != cyrillicCapitalLetterA {
    print("These two characters aren't equivalent.")
}
// Prints "These two characters aren't equivalent."
```


### prefix and Suffix Equality

To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs `hasPrefix(_:)` and `hasSuffix(_:)` methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value.
  
The examples below consider an array of strings representing the scene locations from the first two acts of Shakespeare‚Äôs Romeo and Juliet:

```swift
let romeoAndJuliet = [
    "Act 1 Scene 1: Verona, A public place",
    "Act 1 Scene 2: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 3: A room in Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 4: A street outside Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 5: The Great Hall in Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 1: Outside Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 2: Capulet's orchard",
    "Act 2 Scene 3: Outside Friar Lawrence's cell",
    "Act 2 Scene 4: A street in Verona",
    "Act 2 Scene 5: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 6: Friar Lawrence's cell"
]
```
You can use the hasPrefix(_:) method with the romeoAndJuliet array to count the number of scenes in Act 1 of the play:

```swift
var act1SceneCount = 0
for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
    if scene.hasPrefix("Act 1 ") {
        act1SceneCount += 1
    }
}
print("There are \(act1SceneCount) scenes in Act 1")
// Prints "There are 5 scenes in Act 1"
```

Similarly, use the hasSuffix(_:) method to count the number of scenes that take place in or around Capulet‚Äôs mansion and Friar Lawrence‚Äôs cell:

```swift
var mansionCount = 0
var cellCount = 0
for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
    if scene.hasSuffix("Capulet's mansion") {
        mansionCount += 1
    } else if scene.hasSuffix("Friar Lawrence's cell") {
        cellCount += 1
    }
}
print("\(mansionCount) mansion scenes; \(cellCount) cell scenes")
// Prints "6 mansion scenes; 2 cell scenes"
```

## Unicode Representations of Strings

When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage, the Unicode scalars in that string are encoded in one of several Unicode-defined encoding forms. Each form encodes the string in small chunks known as code units. These include the UTF-8 encoding form (which encodes a string as 8-bit code units), the UTF-16 encoding form (which encodes a string as 16-bit code units), and the UTF-32 encoding form (which encodes a string as 32-bit code units).
  
Swift provides several different ways to access Unicode representations of strings. You can iterate over the string with a for-in statement, to access its individual Character values as Unicode extended grapheme clusters. 
  
Alternatively, access a String value in one of three other Unicode-compliant representations:

- A collection of UTF-8 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf8 property)
- A collection of UTF-16 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf16 property)
- A collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values, equivalent to the string‚Äôs UTF-32 encoding form (accessed with the string‚Äôs unicodeScalars property)

Each example below shows a different representation of the following string, which is made up of the characters D, o, g, ‚Äº (DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK, or Unicode scalar U+203C), and the üê∂ character (DOG FACE, or Unicode scalar U+1F436):

`let dogString = "Dog‚Äºüê∂"`

### UTF-8 Representation

You can access a UTF-8 representation of a String by iterating over its utf8 property. This property is of type String.UTF8View, which is a collection of unsigned 8-bit (UInt8) values, one for each byte in the string‚Äôs UTF-8 representation:

(img)[https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/UTF8_2x.png]
```swift
for codeUnit in dogString.utf8 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 226 128 188 240 159 144 182 "
```

### UTF-16 Representation

You can access a UTF-16 representation of a String by iterating over its utf16 property. This property is of type String.UTF16View, which is a collection of unsigned 16-bit (UInt16) values, one for each 16-bit code unit in the string‚Äôs UTF-16 representation:

```swift
for codeUnit in dogString.utf16 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 8252 55357 56374 "
```

### Unicode Scalar Representation

You can access a Unicode scalar representation of a String value by iterating over its unicodeScalars property. This property is of type UnicodeScalarView, which is a collection of values of type UnicodeScalar.

Each UnicodeScalar has a value property that returns the scalar‚Äôs 21-bit value, represented within a UInt32 value:

```swift
for scalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
    print("\(scalar.value) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 8252 128054 "
```
