# Strings and Characters

A string is a series of characters, such as "hello, world" or "albatross". Swift strings are represented by the String type. The contents of a String can be accessed in various ways, including as a collection of Character values.
  
Swiftâ€™s String and Character types provide a fast, Unicode-compliant way to work with text in your code. The syntax for string creation and manipulation is lightweight and readable, with a string literal syntax thatâ€™s similar to C. String concatenation is as simple as combining two strings with the + operator, and string mutability is managed by choosing between a constant or a variable, just like any other value in Swift. You can also use strings to insert constants, variables, literals, and expressions into longer strings, in a process known as string interpolation. This makes it easy to create custom string values for display, storage, and printing.

## String Literals

A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks (").

Use a string literal as an initial value for a constant or variable:

```swift
let someString = "Some string literal value"
let exampleString = "Example string literal value"
```

### Multiline String Literals

If you need a string that spans several lines, use a multiline string literalâ€”a sequence of characters surrounded by three double quotation marks:

```swift
let quotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

A multiline string literal includes all of the lines between its opening and closing quotation marks. 

```swift
let singleLineString = "These are the same."
let multilineString = """
These are the same.
"""
```

When your source code includes a line break inside of a multiline string literal, that line break also appears in the stringâ€™s value. If you want to use line breaks to make your source code easier to read, but you **donâ€™t want the line breaks** to be part of the stringâ€™s value, **write a backslash (\) at the end of those lines**:

```swift
let softWrappedQuotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, \
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on \
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

To make a multiline string literal that begins or ends with a line feed, write a blank line as the first or last line. For example:

```swift
let lineBreaks = """

This string starts with a line break.
It also ends with a line break.

"""
```

> A multiline string can be indented to match the surrounding code. The whitespace before the closing quotation marks (""") tells Swift what whitespace to ignore before all of the other lines.   
> However, if you write whitespace at the beginning of a line in addition to whatâ€™s before the closing quotation marks, that whitespace is included.

### Special Characters in String Literals

tring literals can include the following special characters:

- The escaped special characters \0 (null character), \\ (backslash), \t (horizontal tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quotation mark) and \' (single quotation mark)
- An arbitrary Unicode scalar value, written as \u{n}, where n is a 1â€“8 digit hexadecimal number (Unicode is discussed in Unicode below)

```swift
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
// "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
let dollarSign = "\u{24}"        // $,  Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"      // â™¥,  Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}" // ðŸ’–, Unicode scalar U+1F496
```

Because multiline string literals use three double quotation marks instead of just one, you can include a double quotation mark (") inside of a multiline string literal without escaping it. To include the text """ in a multiline string, escape at least one of the quotation marks. For example:

```swift
let threeDoubleQuotationMarks = """
Escaping the first quotation mark \"""
Escaping all three quotation marks \"\"\"
"""
```

### Extended String Delimiters

You can place a string literal within extended delimiters to include special characters in a string without invoking their effect. You place your string within quotation marks (") and surround that with number signs (#). For example, printing the string literal `#"Line 1\nLine 2"#` prints the line feed escape sequence (\n) rather than printing the string across two lines.
  
If you need the special effects of a character in a string literal, match the number of number signs within the string following the escape character (\). For example, if your string is `#"Line 1\nLine 2"#` and you want to break the line, you can use `#"Line 1\#nLine 2"#` instead. Similarly, `###"Line1\###nLine2"###` also breaks the line.
  
String literals created using extended delimiters can also be multiline string literals. You can use extended delimiters to include the text """ in a multiline string, overriding the default behavior that ends the literal. For example:

```swift
let threeMoreDoubleQuotationMarks = #"""
Here are three more double quotes: """
"""#
```
