# Collection Types

Swift provides three primary collection types, known as **arrays**, **sets**, and **dictionaries**, for storing collections of values. Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

![collection](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/CollectionTypes_intro_2x.png "Collection Type")

Arrays, sets, and dictionaries in Swift are always clear about the types of values and keys that they can store.

> Swift’s array, set, and dictionary types are implemented as generic collections. 

## Mutability of Collections

If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that’s created will be mutable. This means that you can **change** (or mutate) the collection after it’s created by adding, **removing**, or **changing** items in the collection. If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents can’t be changed.

## Arrays

An array stores values of the same type in an ordered list. The **same value** can appear in an array multiple times at different positions.

### Array Type Shorthand Syntax

The type of a Swift array is written in full as **Array<Element>**, where Element is the type of values the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand form as [Element]. 

### Creating an Empty Array

You can create an empty array of a certain type using initializer syntax:

```swift
var someInts: [Int] = []
print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
```

Note that the type of the someInts variable is inferred to be [Int] from the type of the initializer.
  
Alternatively, if the context already provides type information, such as a function argument or an already typed variable or constant, you can create an empty array with an empty array literal, which is written as [] (an empty pair of square brackets):

```swift
someInts.append(3)
// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
someInts = []
// someInts is now an empty array, but is still of type [Int]
```

### Creating an Array with a Default Value

Swift’s Array type also provides an initializer for creating an array of a certain size with all of its values set to the same default value.

```swift
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

### Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together

You can create a new array by adding together two existing arrays with compatible types with the addition operator (+). The new array’s type is inferred from the type of the two arrays you add together:

```swift
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]

var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
```

### Creating an Array with an Array Literal

You can also initialize an array with an array literal, which is a shorthand way to write one or more values as an array collection. An array literal is written as a list of values, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets:
  
`[value 1, value 2, value 3]`
The example below creates an array called shoppingList to store String values:

```swift
var shoppingList: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
// shoppingList has been initialized with two initial items
```

Thanks to Swift’s type inference, you don’t have to write the type of the array if you’re initializing it with an array literal containing values of the same type. The initialization of shoppingList could have been written in a shorter form instead:

```swift
var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
```

### Accessing and Modifying an Array

You access and modify an array through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.
  
To find out the number of items in an array, check its read-only count property:

```swift
print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")
// Prints "The shopping list contains 2 items."
```

Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:

```
if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    print("The shopping list is empty.")
} else {
    print("The shopping list isn't empty.")
}
// Prints "The shopping list isn't empty."
```swift

You can add a new item to the end of an array by calling the array’s append(_:) method:

```swift
shoppingList.append("Flour")
// shoppingList now contains 3 items, and someone is making pancakes
```

Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator **(+=)**:

```swift
shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]
// shoppingList now contains 4 items
shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
```

Retrieve a value from the array by using subscript syntax, passing the index of the value you want to retrieve within square brackets immediately after the name of the array:

```swift
var firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is equal to "Eggs"
```

You can use subscript syntax to change an existing value at a given index:

```swift
shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs"
// the first item in the list is now equal to "Six eggs" rather than "Eggs"
```
When you use subscript syntax, the index you specify needs to be valid. For example, writing **shoppingList[shoppingList.count] = "Salt"** to try to append an item to the end of the array results in a runtime **error**.
  
You can also use subscript syntax to** change a range of values at once**, even if **the replacement set of values has a different length than the range you are replacing**. The following example replaces "Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", and "Butter" with "Bananas" and "Apples":

```swift
shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"]
// shoppingList now contains 6 items
```

To insert an item into the array at a specified index, call the array’s **insert(_:at:)** method:

```swift
shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
```

This call to the **insert(_:at:)** method inserts a new item with a value of "Maple Syrup" at the very beginning of the shopping list, indicated by an index of 0.

Similarly, you remove an item from the array with the **remove(at:)** method. This method removes the item at the specified index and returns the removed item (although you can ignore the returned value if you don’t need it):

```swift
let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
```

Any gaps in an array are closed when an item is removed, and so the value at index 0 is once again equal to "Six eggs":

```swift
firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is now equal to "Six eggs"
```

If you want to remove the final item from an array, use the removeLast() method rather than the remove(at:) method to avoid the need to query the array’s count property. Like the remove(at:) method, removeLast() returns the removed item:

```swift
let apples = shoppingList.removeLast()
// the last item in the array has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 5 items, and no apples
// the apples constant is now equal to the removed "Apples" string
```

### Iterating Over an Array

You can iterate over the entire set of values in an array with **the for-in loop**:

```swift
for item in shoppingList {
    print(item)
}
// Six eggs
// Milk
// Flour
// Baking Powder
// Bananas
```

If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the **enumerated()** method to **iterate over the array instead**. For each item in the array, the enumerated() method **returns a tuple** composed of an **integer** and the **item**. The integers start at **zero** and **count** up by one for each item; if you enumerate over a whole array, these integers match the items’ indices. You can decompose the tuple into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:

```swift
for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
// Item 1: Six eggs
// Item 2: Milk
// Item 3: Flour
// Item 4: Baking Powder
// Item 5: Bananas
```

## Sets

A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.

### Hash Values for Set Types

A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set—that is, the type must provide a way to compute a hash value for itself. A hash value is an Int value that’s the same for all objects that compare equally, such that if a == b, the hash value of a is equal to the hash value of b.

### Set Type Syntax

The type of a Swift set is written as Set<Element>, where Element is the type that the set is allowed to store. Unlike arrays, sets don’t have an equivalent shorthand form.

### Creating and Initializing an Empty Set

You can create an empty set of a certain type using initializer syntax:

```swift
var letters = Set<Character>()
print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
// Prints "letters is of type Set<Character> with 0 items."
```

```swift
letters.insert("a")
// letters now contains 1 value of type Character
letters = []
// letters is now an empty set, but is still of type Set<Character>
```

### Creating a Set with an Array Literal

You can also initialize a set with an array literal, as a shorthand way to write one or more values as a set collection.
  
The example below creates a set called favoriteGenres to store String values:

```swift
var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
// favoriteGenres has been initialized with three initial items
```

A set type can’t be inferred from an array literal alone, so the type Set must be explicitly declared. However, because of Swift’s type inference, you don’t have to write the type of the set’s elements if you’re initializing it with an array literal that contains values of just one type. The initialization of favoriteGenres could have been written in a shorter form instead:

```swift
var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
```

### Accessing and Modifying a Set

You access and modify a set through its methods and properties.
  
To find out the number of items in a set, check its read-only count property:

```swift
print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")
// Prints "I have 3 favorite music genres."
```

Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:

```
if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
    print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
} else {
    print("I have particular music preferences.")
}
// Prints "I have particular music preferences."
```swift

You can add a new item into a set by calling the set’s insert(_:) method:

```swift
favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")
// favoriteGenres now contains 4 items
```

You can remove an item from a set by calling the set’s remove(_:) method, which removes the item if it’s a member of the set, and returns the removed value, or returns nil if the set didn’t contain it. Alternatively, all items in a set can be removed with its removeAll() method.

```swift
if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
    print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
} else {
    print("I never much cared for that.")
}
// Prints "Rock? I'm over it."
```

To check whether a set contains a particular item, use the contains(_:) method.

```swift
if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
    print("I get up on the good foot.")
} else {
    print("It's too funky in here.")
}
// Prints "It's too funky in here."
```
### Iterating Over a Set

You can iterate over the values in a set with a for-in loop.

```swift
for genre in favoriteGenres {
    print("\(genre)")
}
// Classical
// Jazz
// Hip hop
```

Swift’s Set type doesn’t have a defined ordering. To iterate over the values of a set in a specific order, use the sorted() method, which returns the set’s elements as an array sorted using the < operator.

```swift
for genre in favoriteGenres.sorted() {
    print("\(genre)")
}
// Classical
// Hip hop
// Jazz
```

## Performing Set Operations

You can efficiently perform fundamental set operations, such as combining two sets together, determining which values two sets have in common, or determining whether two sets contain all, some, or none of the same values.
  
The illustration below depicts two sets—a and b—with the results of various set operations represented by the shaded regions.

![operations](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/setVennDiagram_2x.png)

- Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the values common to both sets.
- Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with values in either set, but not both.
- Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with all of the values in both sets.
- Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with values not in the specified set.

```swift
let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
// []
oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 9]
oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 2, 9]
```

### Set MemberShip and Equality

The illustration below depicts three sets—a, b and c—with overlapping regions representing elements shared among sets. Set a is a superset of set b, because a contains all elements in b. Conversely, set b is a subset of set a, because all elements in b are also contained by a. Set b and set c are disjoint with one another, because they share no elements in common.

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/setEulerDiagram_2x.png)

- Use the “is equal” operator (==) to determine whether two sets contain all of the same values.
- Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to determine whether all of the values of a set are contained in the specified set.
- Use the` isSuperset(of:)` method to determine whether a set contains all of the values in a specified set.
- Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` or isStrictSuperset(of:) methods to determine whether a set is a subset or superset, but not equal to, a specified set.
- Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to determine whether two sets have no values in common.

```swift
let houseAnimals: Set = ["🐶", "🐱"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["🐮", "🐔", "🐑", "🐶", "🐱"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["🐦", "🐭"]

houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals)
// true
```

## Dictionaries

A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary. Unlike items in an array, items in a dictionary don’t have a specified order. You use a dictionary when you need to look up values based on their identifier, in much the same way that a real-world dictionary is used to look up the definition for a particular word.

###  Dictionary Type Shorthand Syntax

The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as `Dictionary<Key, Value>`, where Key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.

### Creating an Empty Dictionary

As with arrays, you can create an empty Dictionary of a certain type by using initializer syntax:

```swift
var namesOfIntegers: [Int: String] = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
// Its keys are of type Int, and its values are of type String.
```

If the context already provides type information, you can create an empty dictionary with an empty dictionary literal, which is written as [:] (a colon inside a pair of square brackets):

```swift
namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
namesOfIntegers = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]
```

### Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal

You can also initialize a dictionary with a dictionary literal, which has a similar syntax to the array literal seen earlier. A dictionary literal is a shorthand way to write one or more key-value pairs as a Dictionary collection.
  
A key-value pair is a combination of a key and a value. In a dictionary literal, the key and value in each key-value pair are separated by a colon. The key-value pairs are written as a list, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets:

`[key 1: value 1, key 2: value 2, key 3: value 3]`

he example below creates a dictionary to store the names of international airports. In this dictionary, the keys are three-letter International Air Transport Association codes, and the values are airport names:

```swift
var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
```

As with arrays, you don’t have to write the type of the dictionary if you’re initializing it with a dictionary literal whose keys and values have consistent types. The initialization of airports could have been written in a shorter form instead:

```swift
var airports = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
```

### Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary

You access and modify a dictionary through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.

As with an array, you find out the number of items in a Dictionary by checking its read-only count property:

```swift
print("The airports dictionary contains \(airports.count) items.")
// Prints "The airports dictionary contains 2 items."
```

Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:

```swift
if airports.isEmpty {
    print("The airports dictionary is empty.")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary isn't empty.")
}
// Prints "The airports dictionary isn't empty."
```

You can add a new item to a dictionary with subscript syntax. Use a new key of the appropriate type as the subscript index, and assign a new value of the appropriate type:

```swift
airports["LHR"] = "London"
// the airports dictionary now contains 3 items
```

You can also use subscript syntax to change the value associated with a particular key:

```swift
airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"
```

As an alternative to subscripting, use a dictionary’s updateValue(_:forKey:) method to set or update the value for a particular key. Like the subscript examples above, the updateValue(_:forKey:) method sets a value for a key if none exists, or updates the value if that key already exists. Unlike a subscript, however, the updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns the old value after performing an update. This enables you to check whether or not an update took place.
  
The updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns an optional value of the dictionary’s value type. For a dictionary that stores String values, for example, the method returns a value of type String?, or “optional String”. This optional value contains the old value for that key if one existed before the update, or nil if no value existed:

```swift
if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."
```

You can also use subscript syntax to retrieve a value from the dictionary for a particular key. Because it’s possible to request a key for which no value exists, a dictionary’s subscript returns an optional value of the dictionary’s value type. If the dictionary contains a value for the requested key, the subscript returns an optional value containing the existing value for that key. Otherwise, the subscript returns nil:

```swift
if let airportName = airports["DUB"] {
    print("The name of the airport is \(airportName).")
} else {
    print("That airport isn't in the airports dictionary.")
}
// Prints "The name of the airport is Dublin Airport."
```

You can use subscript syntax to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary by assigning a value of nil for that key:

```swift
airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" isn't the real airport for APL, so delete it
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now been removed from the dictionary
```

Alternatively, remove a key-value pair from a dictionary with the removeValue(forKey:) method. This method removes the key-value pair if it exists and returns the removed value, or returns nil if no value existed:

```swift
if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary doesn't contain a value for DUB.")
}
// Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."
```

### Iterating Over a Dictionary

You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a for-in loop. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple, and you can decompose the tuple’s members into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:

```swfit
for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// LHR: London Heathrow
// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
```

You can also retrieve an iterable collection of a dictionary’s keys or values by accessing its keys and values properties:

```swift
for airportCode in airports.keys {
    print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: LHR
// Airport code: YYZ
```

```swift
for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: London Heathrow
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
```

If you need to use a dictionary’s keys or values with an API that takes an Array instance, initialize a new array with the keys or values property:

```swift
let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["LHR", "YYZ"]

let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
// airportNames is ["London Heathrow", "Toronto Pearson"]
```

Swift’s Dictionary type doesn’t have a defined ordering. To iterate over the keys or values of a dictionary in a specific order, use the sorted() method on its keys or values property.
