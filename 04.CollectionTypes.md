# Collection Types

Swift provides three primary collection types, known as **arrays**, **sets**, and **dictionaries**, for storing collections of values. Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

Arrays, sets, and dictionaries in Swift are always clear about the types of values and keys that they can store.

> Swift’s array, set, and dictionary types are implemented as generic collections. 

## Mutability of Collections

If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that’s created will be mutable. This means that you can **change** (or mutate) the collection after it’s created by adding, **removing**, or **changing** items in the collection. If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents can’t be changed.

## Arrays

An array stores values of the same type in an ordered list. The **same value** can appear in an array multiple times at different positions.

### Array Type Shorthand Syntax

The type of a Swift array is written in full as **Array<Element>**, where Element is the type of values the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand form as [Element]. 

### Creating an Empty Array

You can create an empty array of a certain type using initializer syntax:

```swift
var someInts: [Int] = []
print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
```

Note that the type of the someInts variable is inferred to be [Int] from the type of the initializer.
  
Alternatively, if the context already provides type information, such as a function argument or an already typed variable or constant, you can create an empty array with an empty array literal, which is written as [] (an empty pair of square brackets):

```swift
someInts.append(3)
// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
someInts = []
// someInts is now an empty array, but is still of type [Int]
```

### Creating an Array with a Default Value

Swift’s Array type also provides an initializer for creating an array of a certain size with all of its values set to the same default value.

```swift
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

### Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together

You can create a new array by adding together two existing arrays with compatible types with the addition operator (+). The new array’s type is inferred from the type of the two arrays you add together:

```swift
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]

var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
```

### Creating an Array with an Array Literal

You can also initialize an array with an array literal, which is a shorthand way to write one or more values as an array collection. An array literal is written as a list of values, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets:
  
`[value 1, value 2, value 3]`
The example below creates an array called shoppingList to store String values:

```swift
var shoppingList: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
// shoppingList has been initialized with two initial items
```

Thanks to Swift’s type inference, you don’t have to write the type of the array if you’re initializing it with an array literal containing values of the same type. The initialization of shoppingList could have been written in a shorter form instead:

```swift
var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
```

### Accessing and Modifying an Array

You access and modify an array through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.
  
To find out the number of items in an array, check its read-only count property:

```swift
print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")
// Prints "The shopping list contains 2 items."
```

Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:

```
if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    print("The shopping list is empty.")
} else {
    print("The shopping list isn't empty.")
}
// Prints "The shopping list isn't empty."
```swift

You can add a new item to the end of an array by calling the array’s append(_:) method:

```swift
shoppingList.append("Flour")
// shoppingList now contains 3 items, and someone is making pancakes
```

Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator **(+=)**:

```swift
shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]
// shoppingList now contains 4 items
shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
```

Retrieve a value from the array by using subscript syntax, passing the index of the value you want to retrieve within square brackets immediately after the name of the array:

```swift
var firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is equal to "Eggs"
```

You can use subscript syntax to change an existing value at a given index:

```swift
shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs"
// the first item in the list is now equal to "Six eggs" rather than "Eggs"
```
When you use subscript syntax, the index you specify needs to be valid. For example, writing **shoppingList[shoppingList.count] = "Salt"** to try to append an item to the end of the array results in a runtime **error**.
  
You can also use subscript syntax to** change a range of values at once**, even if **the replacement set of values has a different length than the range you are replacing**. The following example replaces "Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", and "Butter" with "Bananas" and "Apples":

```swift
shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"]
// shoppingList now contains 6 items
```

To insert an item into the array at a specified index, call the array’s **insert(_:at:)** method:

```swift
shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
```

This call to the **insert(_:at:)** method inserts a new item with a value of "Maple Syrup" at the very beginning of the shopping list, indicated by an index of 0.

Similarly, you remove an item from the array with the **remove(at:)** method. This method removes the item at the specified index and returns the removed item (although you can ignore the returned value if you don’t need it):

```swift
let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
```

Any gaps in an array are closed when an item is removed, and so the value at index 0 is once again equal to "Six eggs":

```swift
firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is now equal to "Six eggs"
```

If you want to remove the final item from an array, use the removeLast() method rather than the remove(at:) method to avoid the need to query the array’s count property. Like the remove(at:) method, removeLast() returns the removed item:

```swift
let apples = shoppingList.removeLast()
// the last item in the array has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 5 items, and no apples
// the apples constant is now equal to the removed "Apples" string
```

### Iterating Over an Array

You can iterate over the entire set of values in an array with **the for-in loop**:

```swift
for item in shoppingList {
    print(item)
}
// Six eggs
// Milk
// Flour
// Baking Powder
// Bananas
```

If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the **enumerated()** method to **iterate over the array instead**. For each item in the array, the enumerated() method **returns a tuple** composed of an **integer** and the **item**. The integers start at **zero** and **count** up by one for each item; if you enumerate over a whole array, these integers match the items’ indices. You can decompose the tuple into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:

```swift
for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
// Item 1: Six eggs
// Item 2: Milk
// Item 3: Flour
// Item 4: Baking Powder
// Item 5: Bananas
```
