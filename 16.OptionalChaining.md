#Optional Chaining

Optional chaining is a process for querying and calling properties, methods, and subscripts on an optional that might currently be nil. **If the optional contains a value, the property, method, or subscript call succeeds**; **if the optional is nil, the property, method, or subscript call returns nil**. Multiple queries can be chained together, and the entire chain fails gracefully if any link in the chain is nil.

## Optional Chaining as an Alternative to Forced Unwrapping

You specify optional chaining by placing a question mark (?) after the optional value on which you wish to call a property, method or subscript if the optional is non-nil. This is very similar to placing an exclamation point (!) after an optional value to force the unwrapping of its value. The main difference is that optional chaining fails gracefully when the optional is nil, whereas forced unwrapping triggers a runtime error when the optional is nil.
  
You can use this optional return value to check whether the optional chaining call was successful (the returned optional contains a value), or didn’t succeed due to a nil value in the chain (the returned optional value is nil).
  
Specifically, the result of an optional chaining call is of the same type as the expected return value, but wrapped in an optional. A property that normally returns an Int will return an Int? when accessed through optional chaining.
  
The next several code snippets demonstrate how optional chaining differs from forced unwrapping and enables you to check for success.
  
First, two classes called Person and Residence are defined:

```swift
class Person {
    var residence: Residence?
}

class Residence {
    var numberOfRooms = 1
}
```

If you create a new Person instance, its residence property is default initialized to nil, by virtue of being optional. In the code below, john has a residence property value of nil:

```swift
let john = Person()
// john.residence is nil 

let roomCount = john.residence!.numberOfRooms
// this triggers a runtime error
```

```swift
if let roomCount = john.residence?.numberOfRooms {
    print("John's residence has \(roomCount) room(s).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the number of rooms.")
}
// Prints "Unable to retrieve the number of rooms."
```

You can assign a Residence instance to john.residence, so that it no longer has a nil value:

```swift
john.residence = Residence()

if let roomCount = john.residence?.numberOfRooms {
    print("John's residence has \(roomCount) room(s).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the number of rooms.")
}
// Prints "John's residence has 1 room(s)."
```

## Defining Model Classes for Optional Chaining

You can use optional chaining with calls to properties, methods, and subscripts that are more than one level deep. This enables you to drill down into subproperties within complex models of interrelated types, and to check whether it’s possible to access properties, methods, and subscripts on those subproperties.
  
The Person class is defined in the same way as before:

```swift
class Person {
    var residence: Residence?
}
```

The Residence class is more complex than before. This time, the Residence class defines a variable property called rooms, which is initialized with an empty array of type [Room]:

```swift
class Residence {
    var rooms: [Room] = []
    var numberOfRooms: Int {
        return rooms.count
    }
    subscript(i: Int) -> Room {
        get {
            return rooms[i]
        }
        set {
            rooms[i] = newValue
        }
    }
    func printNumberOfRooms() {
        print("The number of rooms is \(numberOfRooms)")
    }
    var address: Address?
}
```

The Room class used for the rooms array is a simple class with one property called name, and an initializer to set that property to a suitable room name:

```swift
class Room {
    let name: String
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
}
```

The final class in this model is called Address. This class has three optional properties of type String?. The first two properties, buildingName and buildingNumber, are alternative ways to identify a particular building as part of an address. The third property, street, is used to name the street for that address:

```swift
class Address {
    var buildingName: String?
    var buildingNumber: String?
    var street: String?
    func buildingIdentifier() -> String? {
        if let buildingNumber = buildingNumber, let street = street {
            return "\(buildingNumber) \(street)"
        } else if buildingName != nil {
            return buildingName
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }
}
```

## Accessing Properties Through Optional Chaining

You can use optional chaining to access a property on an optional value, and to check if that property access is successful.
  
Use the classes defined above to create a new Person instance, and try to access its numberOfRooms property as before:

```swift
let john = Person()
if let roomCount = john.residence?.numberOfRooms {
    print("John's residence has \(roomCount) room(s).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the number of rooms.")
}
// Prints "Unable to retrieve the number of rooms."
```

You can also attempt to set a property’s value through optional chaining:

```swift
let someAddress = Address()
someAddress.buildingNumber = "29"
someAddress.street = "Acacia Road"
john.residence?.address = someAddress
// john.residence is nil.  
```

In this example, the attempt to set the address property of john.residence will fail, because john.residence is currently nil.
  
The assignment is part of the optional chaining, which means none of the code on the right-hand side of the = operator is evaluated.

## Calling Methods Through Optional Chaining

You can use optional chaining to call a method on an optional value, and to check whether that method call is successful. You can do this even if that method doesn’t define a return value.
  
The printNumberOfRooms() method on the Residence class prints the current value of numberOfRooms. Here’s how the method looks:

```swift
func printNumberOfRooms() {
    print("The number of rooms is \(numberOfRooms)")
}
```

If you call this method on an optional value with optional chaining, the method’s return type will be Void?, not Void, because return values are always of an optional type when called through optional chaining. This enables you to use an if statement to check whether it was possible to call the printNumberOfRooms() method, even though the method doesn’t itself define a return value. Compare the return value from the printNumberOfRooms call against nil to see if the method call was successful:

```swift
if john.residence?.printNumberOfRooms() != nil {
    print("It was possible to print the number of rooms.")
} else {
    print("It was not possible to print the number of rooms.")
}
// Prints "It was not possible to print the number of rooms."
```

Any attempt to set a property through optional chaining returns a value of type Void?, which enables you to compare against nil to see if the property was set successfully:

```swift
if (john.residence?.address = someAddress) != nil {
    print("It was possible to set the address.")
} else {
    print("It was not possible to set the address.")
}
// Prints "It was not possible to set the address."
```

## Accessing Subscripts Through Optional Chaining

You can use optional chaining to try to retrieve and set a value from a subscript on an optional value, and to check whether that subscript call is successful.
  
The example below tries to retrieve the name of the first room in the rooms array of the john.residence property using the subscript defined on the Residence class. Because john.residence is currently nil, the subscript call fails:
swift
```
if let firstRoomName = john.residence?[0].name {
    print("The first room name is \(firstRoomName).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the first room name.")
}
// Prints "Unable to retrieve the first room name."

john.residence?[0] = Room(name: "Bathroom")
//This subscript setting attempt also fails, because residence is currently nil.
```

If you create and assign an actual Residence instance to john.residence, with one or more Room instances in its rooms array, you can use the Residence subscript to access the actual items in the rooms array through optional chaining:

```swift
let johnsHouse = Residence()
johnsHouse.rooms.append(Room(name: "Living Room"))
johnsHouse.rooms.append(Room(name: "Kitchen"))
john.residence = johnsHouse

if let firstRoomName = john.residence?[0].name {
    print("The first room name is \(firstRoomName).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the first room name.")
}
// Prints "The first room name is Living Room."
```

### Accessing Subscripts of Optional Type

If a subscript returns a value of optional type—such as the key subscript of Swift’s Dictionary type—place a question mark after the subscript’s closing bracket to chain on its optional return value:

```swift
var testScores = ["Dave": [86, 82, 84], "Bev": [79, 94, 81]]
testScores["Dave"]?[0] = 91
testScores["Bev"]?[0] += 1
// the "Dave" array is now [91, 82, 84] and the "Bev" array is now [80, 94, 81]

testScores["Brian"]?[0] = 72
//This is fails. the testScores dictionary doesn’t contain a key for "Brian".
```

## Linking Multiple Levels of Chaining

You can link together multiple levels of optional chaining to drill down to properties, methods, and subscripts deeper within a model. However, multiple levels of optional chaining don’t add more levels of optionality to the returned value.
  
To put it another way:

- If the type you are trying to retrieve isn’t optional, it will become optional because of the optional chaining.
- If the type you are trying to retrieve is already optional, it will not become more optional because of the chaining.

Therefore:

- If you try to retrieve an Int value through optional chaining, an Int? is always returned, no matter how many levels of chaining are used.
- Similarly, if you try to retrieve an Int? value through optional chaining, an Int? is always returned, no matter how many levels of chaining are used.

The example below tries to access the street property of the address property of the residence property of john. There are two levels of optional chaining in use here, to chain through the residence and address properties, both of which are of optional type:

```swift
if let johnsStreet = john.residence?.address?.street {
    print("John's street name is \(johnsStreet).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the address.")
}
// Prints "Unable to retrieve the address."
```

If you set an actual Address instance as the value for john.residence.address, and set an actual value for the address’s street property, you can access the value of the street property through multilevel optional chaining:

```swift
let johnsAddress = Address()
johnsAddress.buildingName = "The Larches"
johnsAddress.street = "Laurel Street"
john.residence?.address = johnsAddress

if let johnsStreet = john.residence?.address?.street {
    print("John's street name is \(johnsStreet).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the address.")
}
// Prints "John's street name is Laurel Street."
```

## Chaining on Methods with Optional Return Values

The previous example shows how to retrieve the value of a property of optional type through optional chaining. You can also use optional chaining to call a method that returns a value of optional type, and to chain on that method’s return value if needed.
  
The example below calls the Address class’s buildingIdentifier() method through optional chaining. This method returns a value of type String?. As described above, the ultimate return type of this method call after optional chaining is also String?:

```swift
if let buildingIdentifier = john.residence?.address?.buildingIdentifier() {
    print("John's building identifier is \(buildingIdentifier).")
}
// Prints "John's building identifier is The Larches."
```

If you want to perform further optional chaining on this method’s return value, place the optional chaining question mark after the method’s parentheses:

```swift
if let beginsWithThe =
    john.residence?.address?.buildingIdentifier()?.hasPrefix("The") {
    if beginsWithThe {
        print("John's building identifier begins with \"The\".")
    } else {
        print("John's building identifier doesn't begin with \"The\".")
    }
}
// Prints "John's building identifier begins with "The"."
```
